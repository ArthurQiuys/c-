genesis
genesis 1

1 	in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2	and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3 	and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the 
22	which all are to perish with the using   after the commandments and doctrines of men  
23	which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship  and humility  and neglecting of the body  not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh  
colossians 3
1 	if ye then be risen with christ  seek those things which are above  where christ sitteth on the right hand of god  
2	set your affection on things above  not on things on the earth  
3	for ye are dead  and your life is hid with christ in god  
4	when christ   who is  our life  shall appear  then shall ye also appear with him in glory  
5 	mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth  fornication  uncleanness  inordinate affection  evil concupiscence  and covetousness  which is idolatry  
6	for which things  sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience  
7	in the which ye also walked some time  when ye lived in them  
8 	but now ye also put off all these  anger  wrath  malice  blasphemy  filthy communication out of your mouth  
9	lie not one to another  seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds  
10	and have put on the new  man   which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him  
11	where there is neither greek nor jew  circumcision nor uncircumcision  barbarian  scythian  bond  nor  free  but christ  is  all  and in all  
12 	put on therefore  as the elect of god  holy and beloved  bowels of mercies  kindness  humbleness of mind  meekness  longsuffering  
13	forbearing one another  and forgiving one another  if any man have a quarrel against any  even as christ forgave you  so also  do  ye  
14	and above all these things  put on  charity  which is the bond of perfectness  
15	and let the peace of god rule in your hearts  to the which also ye are called in one body  and be ye thankful  
16	let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom  teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs  singing with grace in your hearts to the lord  
17	and whatsoever ye do in word or deed   do  all in the name of the lord jesus  giving thanks to god and the father by him  
18 	wives  submit yourselves unto your own husbands  as it is fit in the lord  
19	husbands  love  your  wives  and be not bitter against them  
20	children  obey  your  parents in all things  for this is well pleasing unto the lord  
21	fathers  provoke not your children  to anger   lest they be discouraged  
22	servants  obey in all things  your  masters according to the flesh  not with eyeservice  as menpleasers  but in singleness of heart  fearing god  
23	and whatsoever ye do  do  it  heartily  as to the lord  and not unto men  
24	knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance  for ye serve the lord christ  
25	but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done  and there is no respect of persons  
colossians 4
1 	masters  give unto  your  servants that which is just and equal  knowing that ye also have a master in heaven  
2 	continue in prayer  and watch in the same with thanksgiving  
3	withal praying also for us  that god would open unto us a door of utterance  to speak the mystery of christ  for which i am also in bonds  
4	that i may make it manifest  as i ought to speak  
5 	walk in wisdom toward them that are without  redeeming the time  
6	let your speech  be  alway with grace  seasoned with salt  that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man  
7 	all my state shall tychicus declare unto you   who is  a beloved brother  and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord  
8	whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose  that he might know your estate  and comfort your hearts  
9	with onesimus  a faithful and beloved brother  who is  one  of you  they shall make known unto you all things which  are done  here  
10	aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you  and marcus  sister s son to barnabas   touching whom ye received commandments  if he come unto you  receive him   
11	and jesus  which is called justus  who are of the circumcision  these only  are my  fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god  which have been a comfort unto me  
12	epaphras  who is  one  of you  a servant of christ  saluteth you  always labouring fervently for you in prayers  that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god  
13	for i bear him record  that he hath a great zeal for you  and them  that are  in laodicea  and them in hierapolis  
14	luke  the beloved physician  and demas  greet you  
15	salute the brethren which are in laodicea  and nymphas  and the church which is in his house  
16	and when this epistle is read among you  cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans  and that ye likewise read the  epistle  from laodicea  
17	and say to archippus  take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord  that thou fulfil it  
18	the salutation by the hand of me paul  remember my bonds  grace  be  with you  amen    written from rome to colossians by tychicus and onesimus   

1 thessalonians
1 thessalonians 1
1 	paul  and silvanus  and timotheus  unto the church of the thessalonians  which is  in god the father and  in  the lord jesus christ  grace  be  unto you  and peace  from god our father  and the lord jesus christ  
2 	we give thanks to god always for you all  making mention of you in our prayers  
3	remembering without ceasing your work of faith  and labour of love  and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ  in the sight of god and our father  
4	knowing  brethren beloved  your election of god  
5	for our gospel came not unto you in word only  but also in power  and in the holy ghost  and in much assurance  as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake  
6 	and ye became followers of us  and of the lord  having received the word in much affliction  with joy of the holy ghost  
7	so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia  
8	for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia  but also in every place your faith to god ward is spread abroad  so that we need not to speak any thing  
9	for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you  and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god  
10	and to wait for his son from heaven  whom he raised from the dead   even  jesus  which delivered us from the wrath to come  
1 thessalonians 2
1 	for yourselves  brethren  know our entrance in unto you  that it was not in vain  
2	but even after that we had suffered before  and were shamefully entreated  as ye know  at philippi  we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention  
3	for our exhortation  was  not of deceit  nor of uncleanness  nor in guile  
4	but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel  even so we speak  not as pleasing men  but god  which trieth our hearts  
5	for neither at any time used we flattering words  as ye know  nor a cloke of covetousness  god  is  witness  
6	nor of men sought we glory  neither of you  nor  yet  of others  when we might have been burdensome  as the apostles of christ  
7 	but we were gentle among you  even as a nurse cherisheth her children  
8	so being affectionately desirous of you  we were willing to have imparted unto you  not the gospel of god only  but also our own souls  because ye were dear unto us  
9	for ye remember  brethren  our labour and travail  for labouring night and day  because we would not be chargeable unto any of you  we preached unto you the gospel of god  
10	ye  are  witnesses  and god  also   how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe  
11	as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you  as a father  doth  his children  
12	that ye would walk worthy of god  who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory  
13 	for this cause also thank we god without ceasing  because  when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us  ye received  it  not  as  the word of men  but as it is in truth  the word of god  which effectually worketh also in you that believe  
14	for ye  brethren  became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus  for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen  even as they  have  of the jews  
15	who both killed the lord jesus  and their own prophets  and have persecuted us  and they please not god  and are contrary to all men  
16	forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved  to fill up their sins alway  for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost  
17 	but we  brethren  being taken from you for a short time in presence  not in heart  endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire  
18	wherefore we would have come unto you  even i paul  once and again  but satan hindered us  
19	for what  is  our hope  or joy  or crown of rejoicing   are  not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming  
20	for ye are our glory and joy  
1 thessalonians 3
1 	wherefore when we could no longer forbear  we thought it good to be left at athens alone  
2	and sent timotheus  our brother  and minister of god  and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ  to establish you  and to comfort you concerning your faith  
3	that no man should be moved by these afflictions  for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto  
4	for verily  when we were with you  we told you before that we should suffer tribulation  even as it came to pass  and ye know  
5	for this cause  when i could no longer forbear  i sent to know your faith  lest by some means the tempter have tempted you  and our labour be in vain  
6 	but now when timotheus came from you unto us  and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity  and that ye have good remembrance of us always  desiring greatly to see us  as we also  to see  you  
7	therefore  brethren  we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith  
8	for now we live  if ye stand fast in the lord  
9	for what thanks can we render to god again for you  for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god  
10	night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face  and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith  
11 	now god himself and our father  and our lord jesus christ  direct our way unto you  
12	and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another  and toward all  men   even as we  do  toward you  
13	to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god  even our father  at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints  
1 thessalonians 4
1 	furthermore then we beseech you  brethren  and exhort  you  by the lord jesus  that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god   so  ye would abound more and more  
2	for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus  
3	for this is the will of god   even  your sanctification  that ye should abstain from fornication  
4	that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour  
5	not in the lust of concupiscence  even as the gentiles which know not god  
6	that no  man  go beyond and defraud his brother in  any  matter  because that the lord  is  the avenger of all such  as we also have forewarned you and testified  
7	for god hath not called us unto uncleanness  but unto holiness  
8	he therefore that despiseth  despiseth not man  but god  who hath also given unto us his holy spirit  
9 	but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you  for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another  
10	and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia  but we beseech you  brethren  that ye increase more and more  
11	and that ye study to be quiet  and to do your own business  and to work with your own hands  as we commanded you  
12	that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without  and  that  ye may have lack of nothing  
13 	but i would not have you to be ignorant  brethren  concerning them which are asleep  that ye sorrow not  even as others which have no hope  
14	for if we believe that jesus died and rose again  even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him  
15	for this we say unto you by the word of the lord  that we which are alive  and  remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep  
16	for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout  with the voice of the archangel  and with the trump of god  and the dead in christ shall rise first  
17	then we which are alive  and  remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds  to meet the lord in the air  and so shall we ever be with the lord  
18	wherefore comfort one another with these words  
1 thessalonians 5
1 	but of the times and the seasons  brethren  ye have no need that i write unto you  
2	for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night  
3	for when they shall say  peace and safety  then sudden destruction cometh upon them  as travail upon a woman with child  and they shall not escape  
4	but ye  brethren  are not in darkness  that that day should overtake you as a thief  
5	ye are all the children of light  and the children of the day  we are not of the night  nor of darkness  
6 	therefore let us not sleep  as  do  others  but let us watch and be sober  
7	for they that sleep sleep in the night  and they that be drunken are drunken in the night  
8	but let us  who are of the day  be sober  putting on the breastplate of faith and love  and for an helmet  the hope of salvation  
9	for god hath not appointed us to wrath  but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ  
10	who died for us  that  whether we wake or sleep  we should live together with him  
11 	wherefore comfort yourselves together  and edify one another  even as also ye do  
12	and we beseech you  brethren  to know them which labour among you  and are over you in the lord  and admonish you  
13	and to esteem them very highly in love for their work s sake   and  be at peace among yourselves  
14	now we exhort you  brethren  warn them that are unruly  comfort the feebleminded  support the weak  be patient toward all  men   
15	see that none render evil for evil unto any  man   but ever follow that which is good  both among yourselves  and to all  men   
16 	rejoice evermore  
17	pray without ceasing  
18	in every thing give thanks  for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you  
19	quench not the spirit  
20	despise not prophesyings  
21	prove all things  hold fast that which is good  
22	abstain from all appearance of evil  
23 	and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly  and  i pray god  your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ  
24	faithful  is  he that calleth you  who also will do  it   
25	brethren  pray for us  
26	greet all the brethren with an holy kiss  
27	i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren  
28	the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with you  amen    the first  epistle  to the thessalonians was written from athens   

2 thessalonians
2 thessalonians 1
1 	paul  and silvanus  and timotheus  unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ  
2	grace unto you  and peace  from god our father and the lord jesus christ  
3	we are bound to thank god always for you  brethren  as it is meet  because that your faith groweth exceedingly  and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth  
4	so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure  
5 	 which is  a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god  that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god  for which ye also suffer  
6	seeing  it is  a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you  
7	and to you who are troubled rest with us  when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels  
8	in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god  and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ  
9	who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord  and from the glory of his power  
10	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints  and to be admired in all them that believe  because our testimony among you was believed  in that day  
11 	wherefore also we pray always for you  that our god would count you worthy of  this  calling  and fulfil all the good pleasure of  his  goodness  and the work of faith with power  
12	that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you  and ye in him  according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ  
2 thessalonians 2
1 	now we beseech you  brethren  by the coming of our lord jesus christ  and  by  our gathering together unto him  
2	that ye be not soon shaken in mind  or be troubled  neither by spirit  nor by word  nor by letter as from us  as that the day of christ is at hand  
3 	let no man deceive you by any means  for  that day shall not come   except there come a falling away first  and that man of sin be revealed  the son of perdition  
4	who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god  or that is worshipped  so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god  shewing himself that he is god  
5	remember ye not  that  when i was yet with you  i told you these things  
6	and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time  
7	for the mystery of iniquity doth already work  only he who now letteth  will let   until he be taken out of the way  
8	and then shall that wicked be revealed  whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth  and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming  
9	 even him   whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders  
10	and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish  because they received not the love of the truth  that they might be saved  
11	and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion  that they should believe a lie  
12	that they all might be damned who believed not the truth  but had pleasure in unrighteousness  
13 	but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you  brethren beloved of the lord  because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth  
14	whereunto he called you by our gospel  to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ  
15	therefore  brethren  stand fast  and hold the traditions which ye have been taught  whether by word  or our epistle  
16 	now our lord jesus christ himself  and god  even our father  which hath loved us  and hath given  us  everlasting consolation and good hope through grace  
17	comfort your hearts  and stablish you in every good word and work  
2 thessalonians 3
1 	finally  brethren  pray for us  that the word of the lord may have  free  course  and be glorified  even as  it is  with you  
2	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men  for all  men  have not faith  
3	but the lord is faithful  who shall stablish you  and keep  you  from evil  
4	and we have confidence in the lord touching you  that ye both do and will do the things which we command you  
5	and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god  and into the patient waiting for christ  
6 	now we command you  brethren  in the name of our lord jesus christ  that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly  and not after the tradition which he received of us  
7	for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us  for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you  
8	neither did we eat any man s bread for nought  but wrought with labour and travail night and day  that we might not be chargeable to any of you  
9	not because we have not power  but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us  
10	for even when we were with you  this we commanded you  that if any would not work  neither should he eat  
11	for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly  working not at all  but are busybodies  
12	now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ  that with quietness they work  and eat their own bread  
13	but ye  brethren  be not weary in well doing  
14	and if any man obey not our word by this epistle  note that man  and have no company with him  that he may be ashamed  
15	yet count  him  not as an enemy  but admonish  him  as a brother  
16 	now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means  the lord  be  with you all  
17	the salutation of paul with mine own hand  which is the token in every epistle  so i write  
18	the grace of our lord jesus christ  be  with you all  amen    the second  epistle  to the thessalonians was written from athens   

1 timothy
1 timothy 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour  and lord jesus christ   which is  our hope  
2	unto timothy   my  own son in the faith  grace  mercy   and  peace  from god our father and jesus christ our lord  
3	as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus  when i went into macedonia  that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine  
4	neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies  which minister questions  rather than godly edifying which is in faith   so do   
5 	now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart  and  of  a good conscience  and  of  faith unfeigned  
6	from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling  
7	desiring to be teachers of the law  understanding neither what they say  nor whereof they affirm  
8	but we know that the law  is  good  if a man use it lawfully  
9	knowing this  that the law is not made for a righteous man  but for the lawless and disobedient  for the ungodly and for sinners  for unholy and profane  for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers  for manslayers  
10	for whoremongers  for them that defile themselves with mankind  for menstealers  for liars  for perjured persons  and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine  
11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god  which was committed to my trust  
12 	and i thank christ jesus our lord  who hath enabled me  for that he counted me faithful  putting me into the ministry  
13	who was before a blasphemer  and a persecutor  and injurious  but i obtained mercy  because i did  it  ignorantly in unbelief  
14	and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus  
15	this  is  a faithful saying  and worthy of all acceptation  that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners  of whom i am chief  
16	howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy  that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering  for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting  
17	now unto the king eternal  immortal  invisible  the only wise god   be  honour and glory for ever and ever  amen  
18 	this charge i commit unto thee  son timothy  according to the prophecies which went before on thee  that thou by them mightest war a good warfare  
19	holding faith  and a good conscience  which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck  
20	of whom is hymenaeus and alexander  whom i have delivered unto satan  that they may learn not to blaspheme  
1 timothy 2
1 	i exhort therefore  that  first of all  supplications  prayers  intercessions   and  giving of thanks  be made for all men  
2	for kings  and  for  all that are in authority  that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty  
3	for this  is  good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour  
4	who will have all men to be saved  and to come unto the knowledge of the truth  
5	for  there is  one god  and one mediator between god and men  the man christ jesus  
6	who gave himself a ransom for all  to be testified in due time  
7	whereunto i am ordained a preacher  and an apostle   i speak the truth in christ   and  lie not   a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity  
8	i will therefore that men pray every where  lifting up holy hands  without wrath and doubting  
9 	in like manner also  that women adorn themselves in modest apparel  with shamefacedness and sobriety  not with broided hair  or gold  or pearls  or costly array  
10	but  which becometh women professing godliness  with good works  
11	let the woman learn in silence with all subjection  
12	but i suffer not a woman to teach  nor to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence  
13	for adam was first formed  then eve  
14	and adam was not deceived  but the woman being deceived was in the transgression  
15	notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing  if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety  
1 timothy 3
1 	this  is  a true saying  if a man desire the office of a bishop  he desireth a good work  
2	a bishop then must be blameless  the husband of one wife  vigilant  sober  of good behaviour  given to hospitality  apt to teach  
3	not given to wine  no striker  not greedy of filthy lucre  but patient  not a brawler  not covetous  
4	one that ruleth well his own house  having his children in subjection with all gravity  
5	 for if a man know not how to rule his own house  how shall he take care of the church of god   
6	not a novice  lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil  
7	moreover he must have a good report of them which are without  lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil  
8 	likewise  must  the deacons  be  grave  not doubletongued  not given to much wine  not greedy of filthy lucre  
9	holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience  
10	and let these also first be proved  then let them use the office of a deacon  being  found  blameless  
11	even so  must their  wives  be  grave  not slanderers  sober  faithful in all things  
12	let the deacons be the husbands of one wife  ruling their children and their own houses well  
13	for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree  and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus  
14 	these things write i unto thee  hoping to come unto thee shortly  
15	but if i tarry long  that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god  which is the church of the living god  the pillar and ground of the truth  
16	and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness  god was manifest in the flesh  justified in the spirit  seen of angels  preached unto the gentiles  believed on in the world  received up into glory  
1 timothy 4
1 	now the spirit speaketh expressly  that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith  giving heed to seducing spirits  and doctrines of devils  
2	speaking lies in hypocrisy  having their conscience seared with a hot iron  
3	forbidding to marry   and commanding  to abstain from meats  which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth  
4	for every creature of god  is  good  and nothing to be refused  if it be received with thanksgiving  
5	for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer  
6 	if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things  thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ  nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine  whereunto thou hast attained  
7	but refuse profane and old wives  fables  and exercise thyself  rather  unto godliness  
8	for bodily exercise profiteth little  but godliness is profitable unto all things  having promise of the life that now is  and of that which is to come  
9	this  is  a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation  
10	for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach  because we trust in the living god  who is the saviour of all men  specially of those that believe  
11	these things command and teach  
12	let no man despise thy youth  but be thou an example of the believers  in word  in conversation  in charity  in spirit  in faith  in purity  
13	till i come  give attendance to reading  to exhortation  to doctrine  
14	neglect not the gift that is in thee  which was given thee by prophecy  with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery  
15	meditate upon these things  give thyself wholly to them  that thy profiting may appear to all  
16	take heed unto thyself  and unto the doctrine  continue in them  for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself  and them that hear thee  
1 timothy 5
1 	rebuke not an elder  but intreat  him  as a father   and  the younger men as brethren  
2	the elder women as mothers  the younger as sisters  with all purity  
3 	honour widows that are widows indeed  
4	but if any widow have children or nephews  let them learn first to shew piety at home  and to requite their parents  for that is good and acceptable before god  
5	now she that is a widow indeed  and desolate  trusteth in god  and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day  
6	but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth  
7	and these things give in charge  that they may be blameless  
8	but if any provide not for his own  and specially for those of his own house  he hath denied the faith  and is worse than an infidel  
9	let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old  having been the wife of one man  
10	well reported of for good works  if she have brought up children  if she have lodged strangers  if she have washed the saints  feet  if she have relieved the afflicted  if she have diligently followed every good work  
11	but the younger widows refuse  for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ  they will marry  
12	having damnation  because they have cast off their first faith  
13	and withal they learn  to be  idle  wandering about from house to house  and not only idle  but tattlers also and busybodies  speaking things which they ought not  
14	i will therefore that the younger women marry  bear children  guide the house  give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully  
15	for some are already turned aside after satan  
16	if any man or woman that believeth have widows  let them relieve them  and let not the church be charged  that it may relieve them that are widows indeed  
17 	let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour  especially they who labour in the word and doctrine  
18	for the scripture saith  thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn  and  the labourer  is  worthy of his reward  
19	against an elder receive not an accusation  but before two or three witnesses  
20	them that sin rebuke before all  that others also may fear  
21	i charge  thee  before god  and the lord jesus christ  and the elect angels  that thou observe these things without preferring one before another  doing nothing by partiality  
22	lay hands suddenly on no man  neither be partaker of other men s sins  keep thyself pure  
23	drink no longer water  but use a little wine for thy stomach s sake and thine often infirmities  
24	some men s sins are open beforehand  going before to judgment  and some  men  they follow after  
25	likewise also the good works  of some  are manifest beforehand  and they that are otherwise cannot be hid  
1 timothy 6
1 	let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour  that the name of god and  his  doctrine be not blasphemed  
2	and they that have believing masters  let them not despise  them   because they are brethren  but rather do  them  service  because they are faithful and beloved  partakers of the benefit  these things teach and exhort  
3	if any man teach otherwise  and consent not to wholesome words   even  the words of our lord jesus christ  and to the doctrine which is according to godliness  
4	he is proud  knowing nothing  but doting about questions and strifes of words  whereof cometh envy  strife  railings  evil surmisings  
5	perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds  and destitute of the truth  supposing that gain is godliness  from such withdraw thyself  
6 	but godliness with contentment is great gain  
7	for we brought nothing into  this  world   and it is  certain we can carry nothing out  
8	and having food and raiment let us be therewith content  
9	but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare  and  into  many foolish and hurtful lusts  which drown men in destruction and perdition  
10	for the love of money is the root of all evil  which while some coveted after  they have erred from the faith  and pierced themselves through with many sorrows  
11	but thou  o man of god  flee these things  and follow after righteousness  godliness  faith  love  patience  meekness  
12	fight the good fight of faith  lay hold on eternal life  whereunto thou art also called  and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses  
13 	i give thee charge in the sight of god  who quickeneth all things  and  before  christ jesus  who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession  
14	that thou keep  this  commandment without spot  unrebukeable  until the appearing of our lord jesus christ  
15	which in his times he shall shew   who is  the blessed and only potentate  the king of kings  and lord of lords  
16	who only hath immortality  dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto  whom no man hath seen  nor can see  to whom  be  honour and power everlasting  amen  
17	charge them that are rich in this world  that they be not highminded  nor trust in uncertain riches  but in the living god  who giveth us richly all things to enjoy  
18	that they do good  that they be rich in good works  ready to distribute  willing to communicate  
19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come  that they may lay hold on eternal life  
20	o timothy  keep that which is committed to thy trust  avoiding profane  and  vain babblings  and oppositions of science falsely so called  
21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith  grace  be  with thee  amen    the first to timothy was written from laodicea  which is the chiefest city of phrygia pacatiana   

2 timothy
2 timothy 1
1 	paul  an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god  according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus  
2	to timothy   my  dearly beloved son  grace  mercy   and  peace  from god the father and christ jesus our lord  
3	i thank god  whom i serve from  my  forefathers with pure conscience  that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day  
4	greatly desiring to see thee  being mindful of thy tears  that i may be filled with joy  
5	when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee  which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois  and thy mother eunice  and i am persuaded that in thee also  
6 	wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god  which is in thee by the putting on of my hands  
7	for god hath not given us the spirit of fear  but of power  and of love  and of a sound mind  
8	be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord  nor of me his prisoner  but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god  
9	who hath saved us  and called  us  with an holy calling  not according to our works  but according to his own purpose and grace  which was given us in christ jesus before the world began  
10	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ  who hath abolished death  and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel  
11	whereunto i am appointed a preacher  and an apostle  and a teacher of the gentiles  
12	for the which cause i also suffer these things  nevertheless i am not ashamed  for i know whom i have believed  and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day  
13	hold fast the form of sound words  which thou hast heard of me  in faith and love which is in christ jesus  
14	that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us  
15 	this thou knowest  that all they which are in asia be turned away from me  of whom are phygellus and hermogenes  
16	the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus  for he oft refreshed me  and was not ashamed of my chain  
17	but  when he was in rome  he sought me out very diligently  and found  me   
18	the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day  and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus  thou knowest very well  
2 timothy 2
1 	thou therefore  my son  be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus  
2	and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses  the same commit thou to faithful men  who shall be able to teach others also  
3	thou therefore endure hardness  as a good soldier of jesus christ  
4	no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of  this  life  that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier  
5	and if a man also strive for masteries   yet  is he not crowned  except he strive lawfully  
6	the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits  
7	consider what i say  and the lord give thee understanding in all things  
8 	remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel  
9	wherein i suffer trouble  as an evil doer   even  unto bonds  but the word of god is not bound  
10	therefore i endure all things for the elect s sakes  that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory  
11	 it is  a faithful saying  for if we be dead with  him   we shall also live with  him   
12	if we suffer  we shall also reign with  him   if we deny  him   he also will deny us  
13	if we believe not   yet  he abideth faithful  he cannot deny himself  
14 	of these things put  them  in remembrance  charging  them  before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit   but  to the subverting of the hearers  
15	study to shew thyself approved unto god  a workman that needeth not to be ashamed  rightly dividing the word of truth  
16	but shun profane  and  vain babblings  for they will increase unto more ungodliness  
17	and their word will eat as doth a canker  of whom is hymenaeus and philetus  
18	who concerning the truth have erred  saying that the resurrection is past already  and overthrow the faith of some  
19 	nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure  having this seal  the lord knoweth them that are his  and  let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity  
20	but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver  but also of wood and of earth  and some to honour  and some to dishonour  
21	if a man therefore purge himself from these  he shall be a vessel unto honour  sanctified  and meet for the master s use   and  prepared unto every good work  
22 	flee also youthful lusts  but follow righteousness  faith  charity  peace  with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart  
23	but foolish and unlearned questions avoid  knowing that they do gender strifes  
24	and the servant of the lord must not strive  but be gentle unto all  men   apt to teach  patient  
25	in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves  if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth  
26	and  that  they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil  who are taken captive by him at his will  
2 timothy 3
1 	this know also  that in the last days perilous times shall come  
2	for men shall be lovers of their own selves  covetous  boasters  proud  blasphemers  disobedient to parents  unthankful  unholy  
3	without natural affection  trucebreakers  false accusers  incontinent  fierce  despisers of those that are good  
4	traitors  heady  highminded  lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god  
5	having a form of godliness  but denying the power thereof  from such turn away  
6	for of this sort are they which creep into houses  and lead captive silly women laden with sins  led away with divers lusts  
7	ever learning  and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth  
8	now as jannes and jambres withstood moses  so do these also resist the truth  men of corrupt minds  reprobate concerning the faith  
9	but they shall proceed no further  for their folly shall be manifest unto all  men   as theirs also was  
10 	but thou hast fully known my doctrine  manner of life  purpose  faith  longsuffering  charity  patience  
11	persecutions  afflictions  which came unto me at antioch  at iconium  at lystra  what persecutions i endured  but out of  them  all the lord delivered me  
12	yea  and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution  
13	but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse  deceiving  and being deceived  
14	but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of  knowing of whom thou hast learned  them   
15	and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures  which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus  
16	all scripture  is  given by inspiration of god  and  is  profitable for doctrine  for reproof  for correction  for instruction in righteousness  
17	that the man of god may be perfect  throughly furnished unto all good works  
2 timothy 4
1 	i charge  thee  therefore before god  and the lord jesus christ  who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom  
2	preach the word  be instant in season  out of season  reprove  rebuke  exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine  
3	for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine  but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers  having itching ears  
4	and they shall turn away  their  ears from the truth  and shall be turned unto fables  
5	but watch thou in all things  endure afflictions  do the work of an evangelist  make full proof of thy ministry  
6	for i am now ready to be offered  and the time of my departure is at hand  
7	i have fought a good fight  i have finished  my  course  i have kept the faith

titus
titus 1
1 	paul  a servant of god  and an apostle of jesus christ  according to the faith of god s elect  and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness  
2	in hope of eternal life  which god  that cannot lie  promised before the world began  
3	but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching  which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour  
4	to titus   mine  own son after the common faith  grace  mercy   and  peace  from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour  
5 	for this cause left i thee in crete  that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting  and ordain elders in every city  as i had appointed thee  
6 	if any be blameless  the husband of one wife  having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly  
7	for a bishop must be blameless  as the steward of god  not selfwilled  not soon angry  not given to wine  no striker  not given to filthy lucre  
8	but a lover of hospitality  a lover of good men  sober  just  holy  temperate  
9	holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught  that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers  
10	for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers  specially they of the circumcision  
11	whose mouths must be stopped  who subvert whole houses  teaching things which they ought not  for filthy lucre s sake  
12	one of themselves   even  a prophet of their own  said  the cretians  are  alway liars  evil beasts  slow bellies  
13	this witness is true  wherefore rebuke them sharply  that they may be sound in the faith  
14	not giving heed to jewish fables  and commandments of men  that turn from the truth  
15	unto the pure all things  are  pure  but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving  is  nothing pure  but even their mind and conscience is defiled  
16	they profess that they know god  but in works they deny  him   being abominable  and disobedient  and unto every good work reprobate  
titus 2
1 	but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  
2	that the aged men be sober  grave  temperate  sound in faith  in charity  in patience  
3	the aged women likewise  that  they be  in behaviour as becometh holiness  not false accusers  not given to much wine  teachers of good things  
4	that they may teach the young women to be sober  to love their husbands  to love their children  
5	 to be  discreet  chaste  keepers at home  good  obedient to their own husbands  that the word of god be not blasphemed  
6	young men likewise exhort to be sober minded  
7	in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works  in doctrine  shewing  uncorruptness  gravity  sincerity  
8	sound speech  that cannot be condemned  that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed  having no evil thing to say of you  
9	 exhort  servants to be obedient unto their own masters   and  to please  them  well in all  things   not answering again  
10	not purloining  but shewing all good fidelity  that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things  
11 	for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men  
12	teaching us that  denying ungodliness and worldly lusts  we should live soberly  righteously  and godly  in this present world  
13	looking for that blessed hope  and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ  
14	who gave himself for us  that he might redeem us from all iniquity  and purify unto himself a peculiar people  zealous of good works  
15 	these things speak  and exhort  and rebuke with all authority  let no man despise thee  
titus 3
1 	put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers  to obey magistrates  to be ready to every good work  
2	to speak evil of no man  to be no brawlers   but  gentle  shewing all meekness unto all men  
3	for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish  disobedient  deceived  serving divers lusts and pleasures  living in malice and envy  hateful   and  hating one another  
4	but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared  
5	not by works of righteousness which we have done  but according to his mercy he saved us  by the washing of regeneration  and renewing of the holy ghost  
6	which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour  
7	that being justified by his grace  we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life  
8	 this is  a faithful saying  and these things i will that thou affirm constantly  that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works  these things are good and profitable unto men  
9 	but avoid foolish questions  and genealogies  and contentions  and strivings about the law  for they are unprofitable and vain  
10	a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject  
11	knowing that he that is such is subverted  and sinneth  being condemned of himself  
12	when i shall send artemas unto thee  or tychicus  be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis  for i have determined there to winter  
13	bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently  that nothing be wanting unto them

7	for we have great joy and consolation in thy love  because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee  brother  
8 	wherefore  though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient  
9	yet for love s sake i rather beseech  thee   being such an one as paul the aged  and now also a prisoner of jesus christ  
10	i beseech thee for my son onesimus  whom i have begotten in my bonds  
11	which in time past was to thee unprofitable  but now profitable to thee and to me  
12	whom i have sent again  thou therefore receive him  that is  mine own bowels  
13	whom i would have retained with me  that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel  
14	but without thy mind would i do nothing  that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity  but willingly  
15	for perhaps he therefore departed for a season  that thou shouldest receive him for ever  
16	not now as a servant  but above a servant  a brother beloved  specially to me  but how much more unto thee  both in the flesh  and in the lord  
17	if thou count me therefore a partner  receive him as myself  
18	if he hath wronged thee  or oweth  thee  ought  put that on mine account

hebrews
hebrews 1
1 	god  who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets  
2	hath in these last days spoken unto us by  his  son  whom he hath appointed heir of all things  by whom also he made the worlds  
3	who being the brightness of  his  glory  and the express image of his person  and upholding all things by the word of his power  when he had by himself purged our sins  sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high  
4 	being made so much better than the angels  as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they  
5	for unto which of the angels said he at any time  thou art my son  this day have i begotten thee  and again  i will be to him a father  and he shall be to me a son  
6	and again  when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world  he saith  and let all the angels of god worship him  
7	and of the angels he saith  who maketh his angels spirits  and his ministers a flame of fire  
8	but unto the son  he saith   thy throne  o god   is  for ever and ever  a sceptre of righteousness  is  the sceptre of thy kingdom  
9	thou hast loved righteousness  and hated iniquity  therefore god   even  thy god  hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows  
10	and  thou  lord  in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth  and the heavens are the works of thine hands  
11	they shall perish  but thou remainest  and they all shall wax old as doth a garment  
12	and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up  and they shall be changed  but thou art the same  and thy years shall not fail  
13	but to which of the angels said he at any time  sit on my right hand  until i make thine enemies thy footstool  
14	are they not all ministering spirits  sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation  
hebrews 2
1 	therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard  lest at any time we should let  them  slip  
2	for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast  and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward  
3	how shall we escape  if we neglect so great salvation  which at the first began to be spoken by the lord  and was confirmed unto us by them that heard  him   
4	god also bearing  them  witness  both with signs and wonders  and with divers miracles  and gifts of the holy ghost  according to his own will  
5 	for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come  whereof we speak  
6	but one in a certain place testified  saying  what is man  that thou art mindful of him  or the son of man  that thou visitest him  
7	thou madest him a little lower than the angels  thou crownedst him with glory and honour  and didst set him over the works of thy hands  
8	thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet  for in that he put all in subjection under him  he left nothing  that is  not put under him  but now we see not yet all things put under him  
9	but we see jesus  who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death  crowned with glory and honour  that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man  
10 	for it became him  for whom  are  all things  and by whom  are  all things  in bringing many sons unto glory  to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings  
11	for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified  are  all of one  for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren  
12	saying  i will declare thy name unto my brethren  in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee  
13	and again  i will put my trust in him  and again  behold i and the children which god hath given me  
14 	forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood  he also himself likewise took part of the same  that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death  that is  the devil  
15	and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage  
16	for verily he took not on  him the nature of  angels  but he took on  him  the seed of abraham  
17	wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto  his  brethren  that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things  pertaining  to god  to make reconciliation for the sins of the people  
18	for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted  he is able to succour them that are tempted  
hebrews 3
1 	wherefore  holy brethren  partakers of the heavenly calling  consider the apostle and high priest of our profession  christ jesus  
2	who was faithful to him that appointed him  as also moses  was faithful  in all his house  
3	for this  man  was counted worthy of more glory than moses  inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house  
4	for every house is builded by some  man   but he that built all things  is  god  
5	and moses verily  was  faithful in all his house  as a servant  for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after  
6	but christ as a son over his own house  whose house are we  if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end  
7 	wherefore  as the holy ghost saith  to day if ye will hear his voice  
8	harden not your hearts  as in the provocation  in the day of temptation in the wilderness  
9	when your fathers tempted me  proved me  and saw my works forty years  
10	wherefore i was grieved with that generation  and said  they do alway err in  their  heart  and they have not known my ways  
11	so i sware in my wrath  they shall not enter into my rest   
12	take heed  brethren  lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief  in departing from the living god  
13	but exhort one another daily  while it is called to day  lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin  
14	for we are made partakers of christ  if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end  
15	while it is said  to day if ye will hear his voice  harden not your hearts  as in the provocation  
16	for some  when they had heard  did provoke  howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses  
17	but with whom was he grieved forty years   was it  not with them that had sinned  whose carcases fell in the wilderness  
18	and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest  but to them that believed not  
19	so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief  
hebrews 4
1 	let us therefore fear  lest  a promise being left  us  of entering into his rest  any of you should seem to come short of it  
2	for unto us was the gospel preached  as well as unto them  but the word preached did not profit them  not being mixed with faith in them that heard  it   
3	for we which have believed do enter into rest  as he said  as i have sworn in my wrath  if they shall enter into my rest  although the works were finished from the foundation of the world  
4	for he spake in a certain place of the seventh  day  on this wise  and god did rest the seventh day from all his works  
5	and in this  place  again  if they shall enter into my rest  
6	seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein  and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief  
7	again  he limiteth a certain day  saying in david  to day  after so long a time  as it is said  to day if ye will hear his voice  harden not your hearts  
8	for if jesus had given them rest  then would he not afterward have spoken of another day  
9	there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god  
10	for he that is entered into his rest  he also hath ceased from his own works  as god  did  from his  
11 	let us labour therefore to enter into that rest  lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief  
12	for the word of god  is  quick  and powerful  and sharper than any twoedged sword  piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit  and of the joints and marrow  and  is  a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart  
13	neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight  but all things  are  naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do  
14	seeing then that we have a great high priest  that is passed into the heavens  jesus the son of god  let us hold fast  our  profession  
15	for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities  but was in all points tempted like as  we are  yet  without sin  
16	let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace  that we may obtain mercy  and find grace to help in time of need  
hebrews 5
1 	for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things  pertaining  to god  that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins  
2	who can have compassion on the ignorant  and on them that are out of the way  for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity  
3	and by reason hereof he ought  as for the people  so also for himself  to offer for sins  
4	and no man taketh this honour unto himself  but he that is called of god  as  was  aaron  
5	so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest  but he that said unto him  thou art my son  to day have i begotten thee  
6	as he saith also in another  place   thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  
7	who in the days of his flesh  when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death  and was heard in that he feared  
8	though he were a son  yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered  
9	and being made perfect  he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him  
10 	called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec  
11	of whom we have many things to say  and hard to be uttered  seeing ye are dull of hearing  
12	for when for the time ye ought to be teachers  ye have need that one teach you again which  be  the first principles of the oracles of god  and are become such as have need of milk  and not of strong meat  
13	for every one that useth milk  is  unskilful in the word of righteousness  for he is a babe  
14	but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age   even  those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil  
hebrews 6
1 	therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ  let us go on unto perfection  not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works  and of faith toward god  
2	of the doctrine of baptisms  and of laying on of hands  and of resurrection of the dead  and of eternal judgment  
3	and this will we do  if god permit  
4	for  it is  impossible for those who were once enlightened  and have tasted of the heavenly gift  and were made partakers of the holy ghost  
5	and have tasted the good word of god  and the powers of the world to come  
6	if they shall fall away  to renew them again unto repentance  seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh  and put  him  to an open shame  
7	for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it  and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed  receiveth blessing from god  
8	but that which beareth thorns and briers  is  rejected  and  is  nigh unto cursing  whose end  is  to be burned  
9 	but  beloved  we are persuaded better things of you  and things that accompany salvation  though we thus speak  
10	for god  is  not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love  which ye have shewed toward his name  in that ye have ministered to the saints  and do minister  
11	and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end  
12	that ye be not slothful  but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises  
13	for when god made promise to abraham  because he could swear by no greater  he sware by himself  
14	saying  surely blessing i will bless thee  and multiplying i will multiply thee  
15	and so  after he had patiently endured  he obtained the promise  
16	for men verily swear by the greater  and an oath for confirmation  is  to them an end of all strife  
17	wherein god  willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel  confirmed  it  by an oath  
18	that by two immutable things  in which  it was  impossible for god to lie  we might have a strong consolation  who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us  
19	which  hope  we have as an anchor of the soul  both sure and stedfast  and which entereth into that within the veil  
20	whither the forerunner is for us entered   even  jesus  made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  
hebrews 7
1 	for this melchisedec  king of salem  priest of the most high god  who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings  and blessed him  
2	to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all  first being by interpretation king of righteousness  and after that also king of salem  which is  king of peace  
3	without father  without mother  without descent  having neither beginning of days  nor end of life  but made like unto the son of god  abideth a priest continually  
4	now consider how great this man  was   unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils  
5	and verily they that are of the sons of levi  who receive the office of the priesthood  have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law  that is  of their brethren  though they come out of the loins of abraham  
6	but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham  and blessed him that had the promises  
7	and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better  
8	and here men that die receive tithes  but there he  receiveth them   of whom it is witnessed that he liveth  
9	and as i may so say  levi also  who receiveth tithes  payed tithes in abraham  
10	for he was yet in the loins of his father  when melchisedec met him  
11 	if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood   for under it the people received the law   what further need  was there  that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec  and not be called after the order of aaron  
12	for the priesthood being changed  there is made of necessity a change also of the law  
13	for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe  of which no man gave attendance at the altar  
14	for  it is  evident that our lord sprang out of juda  of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood  
15	and it is yet far more evident  for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest  
16	who is made  not after the law of a carnal commandment  but after the power of an endless life  
17	for he testifieth  thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  
18	for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof  
19	for the law made nothing perfect  but the bringing in of a better hope  did   by the which we draw nigh unto god  
20	and inasmuch as not without an oath  he was made priest   
21	 for those priests were made without an oath  but this with an oath by him that said unto him  the lord sware and will not repent  thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec   
22	by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament  
23	and they truly were many priests  because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death  
24	but this  man   because he continueth ever  hath an unchangeable priesthood  
25	wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him  seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them  
26	for such an high priest became us   who is  holy  harmless  undefiled  separate from sinners  and made higher than the heavens  
27	who needeth not daily  as those high priests  to offer up sacrifice  first for his own sins  and then for the people s  for this he did once  when he offered up himself  
28	for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity  but the word of the oath  which was since the law   maketh  the son  who is consecrated for evermore  
hebrews 8
1 	now of the things which we have spoken  this is  the sum  we have such an high priest  who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens  
2	a minister of the sanctuary  and of the true tabernacle  which the lord pitched  and not man  
3	for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices  wherefore  it is  of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer  
4	for if he were on earth  he should not be a priest  seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law  
5	who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things  as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle  for  see  saith he   that  thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount  
6 	but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry  by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant  which was established upon better promises  
7	for if that first  covenant  had been faultless  then should no place have been sought for the second  
8	for finding fault with them  he saith  behold  the days come  saith the lord  when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah  
9	not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt  because they continued not in my covenant  and i regarded them not  saith the lord  
10	for this  is  the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days  saith the lord  i will put my laws into their mind  and write them in their hearts  and i will be to them a god  and they shall be to me a people  
11	and they shall not teach every man his neighbour  and every man his brother  saying  know the lord  for all shall know me  from the least to the greatest  
12	for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness  and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more  
13	in that he saith  a new  covenant   he hath made the first old  now that which decayeth and waxeth old  is  ready to vanish away  
hebrews 9
1 	then verily the first  covenant  had also ordinances of divine service  and a worldly sanctuary  
2	for there was a tabernacle made  the first  wherein  was  the candlestick  and the table  and the shewbread  which is called the sanctuary  
3	and after the second veil  the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all  
4	which had the golden censer  and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold  wherein  was  the golden pot that had manna  and aaron s rod that budded  and the tables of the covenant  
5	and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat  of which we cannot now speak particularly  
6	now when these things were thus ordained  the priests went always into the first tabernacle  accomplishing the service  of god   
7	but into the second  went  the high priest alone once every year  not without blood  which he offered for himself  and  for  the errors of the people  
8 	the holy ghost this signifying  that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest  while as the first tabernacle was yet standing  
9	which  was  a figure for the time then present  in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices  that could not make him that did the service perfect  as pertaining to the conscience  
10	 which stood  only in meats and drinks  and divers washings  and carnal ordinances  imposed  on them  until the time of reformation  
11	but christ being come an high priest of good things to come  by a greater and more perfect tabernacle  not made with hands  that is to say  not of this building  
12	neither by the blood of goats and calves  but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place  having obtained eternal redemption  for us   
13	for if the blood of bulls and of goats  and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean  sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh  
14	how much more shall the blood of christ  who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god  purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god  
15 	and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament  that by means of death  for the redemption of the transgressions  that were  under the first testament  they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance  
16	for where a testament  is   there must also of necessity be the death of the testator  
17	for a testament  is  of force after men are dead  otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth  
18	whereupon neither the first  testament  was dedicated without blood  
19	for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law  he took the blood of calves and of goats  with water  and scarlet wool  and hyssop  and sprinkled both the book  and all the people  
20	saying  this  is  the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you  
21	moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle  and all the vessels of the ministry  
22	and almost all things are by the law purged with blood  and without shedding of blood is no remission  
23 	 it was  therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these  but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these  
24	for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands   which are  the figures of the true  but into heaven itself  now to appear in the presence of god for us  
25	nor yet that he should offer himself often  as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others  
26	for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world  but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself  
27	and as it is appointed unto men once to die  but after this the judgment  
28	so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many  and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation  
hebrews 10
1 	for the law having a shadow of good things to come   and  not the very image of the things  can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect  
2	for then would they not have ceased to be offered  because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins  
3	but in those  sacrifices there is  a remembrance again  made  of sins every year  
4	for  it is  not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins  
5	wherefore when he cometh into the world  he saith  sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not  but a body hast thou prepared me  
6	in burnt offerings and  sacrifices  for sin thou hast had no pleasure  
7 	then said i  lo  i come  in the volume of the book it is written of me   to do thy will  o god  
8	above when he said  sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and  offering  for sin thou wouldest not  neither hadst pleasure  therein   which are offered by the law  
9	then said he  lo  i come to do thy will  o god  he taketh away the first  that he may establish the second  
10	by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once  for all   
11	and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices  which can never take away sins  
12	but this man  after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever  sat down on the right hand of god  
13	from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool  
14	for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified  
15	 whereof  the holy ghost also is a witness to us  for after that he had said before  
16	this  is  the covenant that i will make with them after those days  saith the lord  i will put my laws into their hearts  and in their minds will i write them  
17	and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more  
18	now where remission of these  is  there is  no more offering for sin  
19 	having therefore  brethren  boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus  
20	by a new and living way  which he hath consecrated for us  through the veil  that is to say  his flesh  
21	and  having  an high priest over the house of god  
22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith  having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience  and our bodies washed with pure water  
23	let us hold fast the profession of  our  faith without wavering   for he  is  faithful that promised   
24	and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works  
25	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together  as the manner of some  is   but exhorting  one another   and so much the more  as ye see the day approaching  
26	for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth  there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins  
27	but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation  which shall devour the adversaries  
28	he that despised moses  law died without mercy under two or three witnesses  
29	of how much sorer punishment  suppose ye  shall he be thought worthy  who hath trodden under foot the son of god  and hath counted the blood of the covenant  wherewith he was sanctified  an unholy thing  and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace  
30	for we know him that hath said  vengeance  belongeth  unto me  i will recompense  saith the lord  and again  the lord shall judge his people  
31	 it is  a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god  
32	but call to remembrance the former days  in which  after ye were illuminated  ye endured a great fight of afflictions  
33	partly  whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions  and partly  whilst ye became companions of them that were so used  
34	for ye had compassion of me in my bonds  and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods  knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance  
35	cast not away therefore your confidence  which hath great recompence of reward  
36	for ye have need of patience  that  after ye have done the will of god  ye might receive the promise  
37	for yet a little while  and he that shall come will come  and will not tarry  
38	now the just shall live by faith  but if  any man  draw back  my soul shall have no pleasure in him  
39	but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition  but of them that believe to the saving of the soul  
hebrews 11
1 	now faith is the substance of things hoped for  the evidence of things not seen  
2	for by it the elders obtained a good report  
3	through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god  so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear  
4 	by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain  by which he obtained witness that he was righteous  god testifying of his gifts  and by it he being dead yet speaketh  
5	by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death  and was not found  because god had translated him  for before his translation he had this testimony  that he pleased god  
6	but without faith  it is  impossible to please  him   for he that cometh to god must believe that he is  and  that  he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him  
7	by faith noah  being warned of god of things not seen as yet  moved with fear  prepared an ark to the saving of his house  by the which he condemned the world  and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith  
8	by faith abraham  when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance  obeyed  and he went out  not knowing whither he went  
9	by faith he sojourned in the land of promise  as  in  a strange country  dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob  the heirs with him of the same promise  
10	for he looked for a city which hath foundations  whose builder and maker  is  god  
11	through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed  and was delivered of a child when she was past age  because she judged him faithful who had promised  
12	therefore sprang there even of one  and him as good as dead   so many  as the stars of the sky in multitude  and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable  
13	these all died in faith  not having received the promises  but having seen them afar off  and were persuaded of  them   and embraced  them   and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth  
14	for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country  
15	and truly  if they had been mindful of that  country  from whence they came out  they might have had opportunity to have returned  
16	but now they desire a better  country   that is  an heavenly  wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god  for he hath prepared for them a city  
17	by faith abraham  when he was tried  offered up isaac  and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten  son   
18	of whom it was said  that in isaac shall thy seed be called  
19	accounting that god  was  able to raise  him  up  even from the dead  from whence also he received him in a figure  
20	by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come  
21	by faith jacob  when he was a dying  blessed both the sons of joseph  and worshipped   leaning  upon the top of his staff  
22	by faith joseph  when he died  made mention of the departing of the children of israel  and gave commandment concerning his bones  
23	by faith moses  when he was born  was hid three months of his parents  because they saw  he was  a proper child  and they were not afraid of the king s commandment  
24	by faith moses  when he was come to years  refused to be called the son of pharaoh s daughter  
25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god  than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season  
26	esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt  for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward  
27	by faith he forsook egypt  not fearing the wrath of the king  for he endured  as seeing him who is invisible  
28	through faith he kept the passover  and the sprinkling of blood  lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them  
29	by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry  land   which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned  
30	by faith the walls of jericho fell down  after they were compassed about seven days  
31	by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not  when she had received the spies with peace  
32 	and what shall i more say  for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon  and  of  barak  and  of  samson  and  of  jephthae   of  david also  and samuel  and  of  the prophets  
33	who through faith subdued kingdoms  wrought righteousness  obtained promises  stopped the mouths of lions  
34	quenched the violence of fire  escaped the edge of the sword  out of weakness were made strong  waxed valiant in fight  turned to flight the armies of the aliens  
35	women received their dead raised to life again  and others were tortured  not accepting deliverance  that they might obtain a better resurrection  
36	and others had trial of  cruel  mockings and scourgings  yea  moreover of bonds and imprisonment  
37	they were stoned  they were sawn asunder  were tempted  were slain with the sword  they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins  being destitute  afflicted  tormented  
38	 of whom the world was not worthy   they wandered in deserts  and  in  mountains  and  in  dens and caves of the earth  
39	and these all  having obtained a good report through faith  received not the promise  
40	god having provided some better thing for us  that they without us should not be made perfect  
hebrews 12
1 	wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses  let us lay aside every weight  and the sin which doth so easily beset  us   and let us run with patience the race that is set before us  
2	looking unto jesus the author and finisher of  our  faith  who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross  despising the shame  and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god  
3	for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself  lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds  
4 	ye have not yet resisted unto blood  striving against sin  
5	and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children  my son  despise not thou the chastening of the lord  nor faint when thou art rebuked of him  
6	for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth  and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  
7	if ye endure chastening  god dealeth with you as with sons  for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not  
8	but if ye be without chastisement  whereof all are partakers  then are ye bastards  and not sons  
9	furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected  us   and we gave  them  reverence  shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits  and live  
10	for they verily for a few days chastened  us  after their own pleasure  but he for  our  profit  that  we  might be partakers of his holiness  
11	now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous  but grievous  nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby  
12	wherefore lift up the hands which hang down  and the feeble knees  
13	and make straight paths for your feet  lest that which is lame be turned out of the way  but let it rather be healed  
14	follow peace with all  men   and holiness  without which no man shall see the lord  
15	looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god  lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble  you   and thereby many be defiled  
16	lest there  be  any fornicator  or profane person  as esau  who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright  
17	for ye know how that afterward  when he would have inherited the blessing  he was rejected  for he found no place of repentance  though he sought it carefully with tears  
18 	for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched  and that burned with fire  nor unto blackness  and darkness  and tempest  
19	and the sound of a trumpet  and the voice of words  which  voice  they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more  
20	 for they could not endure that which was commanded  and if so much as a beast touch the mountain  it shall be stoned  or thrust through with a dart  
21	and so terrible was the sight   that  moses said  i exceedingly fear and quake   
22	but ye are come unto mount sion  and unto the city of the living god  the heavenly jerusalem  and to an innumerable company of angels  
23	to the general assembly and church of the firstborn  which are written in heaven  and to god the judge of all  and to the spirits of just men made perfect  
24	and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant  and to the blood of sprinkling  that speaketh better things than  that of  abel  
25	see that ye refuse not him that speaketh  for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth  much more  shall not  we  escape   if we turn away from him that  speaketh  from heaven  
26	whose voice then shook the earth  but now he hath promised  saying  yet once more i shake not the earth only  but also heaven  
27	and this  word   yet once more  signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken  as of things that are made  that those things which cannot be shaken may remain  
28	wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved  let us have grace  whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear  
29	for our god  is  a consuming fire  
hebrews 13
1 	let brotherly love continue  
2	be not forgetful to entertain strangers  for thereby some have entertained angels unawares  
3	remember them that are in bonds  as bound with them   and  them which suffer adversity  as being yourselves also in the body  
4	marriage  is  honourable in all  and the bed undefiled  but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge  
5	 let your  conversation  be  without covetousness   and be  content with such things as ye have  for he hath said  i will never leave thee  nor forsake thee  
6	so that we may boldly say  the lord  is  my helper  and i will not fear what man shall do unto me  
7	remember them which have the rule over you  who have spoken unto you the word of god  whose faith follow  considering the end of  their  conversation  
8	jesus christ the same yesterday  and to day  and for ever  
9	be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines  for  it is  a good thing that the heart be established with grace  not with meats  which have not profited them that have been occupied therein  
10	we have an altar  whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle  
11	for the bodies of those beasts  whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin  are burned without the camp  
12	wherefore jesus also  that he might sanctify the people with his own blood  suffered without the gate  
13	let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp  bearing his reproach  
14	for here have we no continuing city  but we seek one to come  
15	by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually  that is  the fruit of  our  lips giving thanks to his name  
16	but to do good and to communicate forget not  for with such sacrifices god is well pleased  
17	obey them that have the rule over you  and submit yourselves  for they watch for your souls  as they that must give account  that they may do it with joy  and not with grief  for that  is  unprofitable for you  
18 	pray for us  for we trust we have a good conscience  in all things willing to live honestly  
19	but i beseech  you  the rather to do this  that i may be restored to you the sooner  
20	now the god of peace  that brought again from the dead our lord jesus  that great shepherd of the sheep  through the blood of the everlasting covenant  
21	make you perfect in every good work to do his will  working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight  through jesus christ  to whom  be  glory for ever and ever  amen  
22	and i beseech you  brethren  suffer the word of exhortation  for i have written a letter unto you in few words  
23	know ye that  our  brother timothy is set at liberty  with whom  if he come shortly  i will see you  
24	salute all them that have the rule over you  and all the saints  they of italy salute you  
25	grace  be  with you all  amen    written to the hebrews from italy  by timothy

james 1
1 	james  a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ  to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad  greeting  
2 	my brethren  count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations  
3	knowing  this   that the trying of your faith worketh patience  
4	but let patience have  her  perfect work  that ye may be perfect and entire  wanting nothing  
5	if any of you lack wisdom  let him ask of god  that giveth to all  men  liberally  and upbraideth not  and it shall be given him  
6	but let him ask in faith  nothing wavering  for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed  
7	for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord  
8	a double minded man  is  unstable in all his ways  
9	let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted  
10	but the rich  in that he is made low  because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away  
11	for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat  but it withereth the grass  and the flower thereof falleth  and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth  so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways  
12	blessed  is  the man that endureth temptation  for when he is tried  he shall receive the crown of life  which the lord hath promised to them that love him  
13 	let no man say when he is tempted  i am tempted of god  for god cannot be tempted with evil  neither tempteth he any man  
14	but every man is tempted  when he is drawn away of his own lust  and enticed  
15	then when lust hath conceived  it bringeth forth sin  and sin  when it is finished  bringeth forth death  
16	do not err  my beloved brethren  
17	every good gift and every perfect gift is from above  and cometh down from the father of lights  with whom is no variableness  neither shadow of turning  
18	of his own will begat he us with the word of truth  that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures  
19 	wherefore  my beloved brethren  let every man be swift to hear  slow to speak  slow to wrath  
20	for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god  
21	wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness  and receive with meekness the engrafted word  which is able to save your souls  
22	but be ye doers of the word  and not hearers only  deceiving your own selves  
23	for if any be a hearer of the word  and not a doer  he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass  
24	for he beholdeth himself  and goeth his way  and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was  
25	but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty  and continueth  therein   he being not a forgetful hearer  but a doer of the work  this man shall be blessed in his deed  
26	if any man among you seem to be religious  and bridleth not his tongue  but deceiveth his own heart  this man s religion  is  vain  
27	pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this  to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction   and  to keep himself unspotted from the world  
james 2
1 	my brethren  have not the faith of our lord jesus christ   the lord  of glory  with respect of persons  
2	for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring  in goodly apparel  and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment  
3	and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing  and say unto him  sit thou here in a good place  and say to the poor  stand thou there  or sit here under my footstool  
4	are ye not then partial in yourselves  and are become judges of evil thoughts  
5	hearken  my beloved brethren  hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith  and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him  
6	but ye have despised the poor  do not rich men oppress you  and draw you before the judgment seats  
7	do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called  
8 	if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  ye do well  
9	but if ye have respect to persons  ye commit sin  and are convinced of the law as transgressors  
10	for whosoever shall keep the whole law  and yet offend in one  point   he is guilty of all  
11	for he that said  do not commit adultery  said also  do not kill  now if thou commit no adultery  yet if thou kill  thou art become a transgressor of the law  
12	so speak ye  and so do  as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty  
13	for he shall have judgment without mercy  that hath shewed no mercy  and mercy rejoiceth against judgment  
14 	what  doth it  profit  my brethren  though a man say he hath faith  and have not works  can faith save him  
15	if a brother or sister be naked  and destitute of daily food  
16	and one of you say unto them  depart in peace  be  ye  warmed and filled  notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body  what  doth it  profit  
17	even so faith  if it hath not works  is dead  being alone  
18	yea  a man may say  thou hast faith  and i have works  shew me thy faith without thy works  and i will shew thee my faith by my works  
19	thou believest that there is one god  thou doest well  the devils also believe  and tremble  
20	but wilt thou know  o vain man  that faith without works is dead  
21	was not abraham our father justified by works  when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar  
22	seest thou how faith wrought with his works  and by works was faith made perfect  
23	and the scripture was fulfilled which saith  abraham believed god  and it was imputed unto him for righteousness  and he was called the friend of god  
24	ye see then how that by works a man is justified  and not by faith only  
25	likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works  when she had received the messengers  and had sent  them  out another way  
26	for as the body without the spirit is dead  so faith without works is dead also  
james 3
1 	my brethren  be not many masters  knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation  
2	for in many things we offend all  if any man offend not in word  the same  is  a perfect man   and  able also to bridle the whole body  
3	behold  we put bits in the horses  mouths  that they may obey us  and we turn about their whole body  
4	behold also the ships  which though  they be  so great  and  are  driven of fierce winds  yet are they turned about with a very small helm  whithersoever the governor listeth  
5	even so the tongue is a little member  and boasteth great things  behold  how great a matter a little fire kindleth  
6	and the tongue  is  a fire  a world of iniquity  so is the tongue among our members  that it defileth the whole body  and setteth on fire the course of nature  and it is set on fire of hell  
7	for every kind of beasts  and of birds  and of serpents  and of things in the sea  is tamed  and hath been tamed of mankind  
8	but the tongue can no man tame   it is  an unruly evil  full of deadly poison  
9	therewith bless we god  even the father  and therewith curse we men  which are made after the similitude of god  
10	out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing  my brethren  these things ought not so to be  
11	doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet  water  and bitter  
12	can the fig tree  my brethren  bear olive berries  either a vine  figs  so  can  no fountain both yield salt water and fresh  
13 	who  is  a wise man and endued with knowledge among you  let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom  
14	but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts  glory not  and lie not against the truth  
15	this wisdom descendeth not from above  but  is  earthly  sensual  devilish  
16	for where envying and strife  is   there  is  confusion and every evil work  
17	but the wisdom that is from above is first pure  then peaceable  gentle   and  easy to be intreated  full of mercy and good fruits  without partiality  and without hypocrisy  
18	and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace  
james 4
1 	from whence  come  wars and fightings among you   come they  not hence   even  of your lusts that war in your members  
2	ye lust  and have not  ye kill  and desire to have  and cannot obtain  ye fight and war  yet ye have not  because ye ask not  
3	ye ask  and receive not  because ye ask amiss  that ye may consume  it  upon your lusts  
4	ye adulterers and adulteresses  know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god  whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god  
5	do ye think that the scripture saith in vain  the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy  
6	but he giveth more grace  wherefore he saith  god resisteth the proud  but giveth grace unto the humble  
7	submit yourselves therefore to god  resist the devil  and he will flee from you  
8	draw nigh to god  and he will draw nigh to you  cleanse  your  hands   ye  sinners  and purify  your  hearts   ye  double minded  
9	be afflicted  and mourn  and weep  let your laughter be turned to mourning  and  your  joy to heaviness  
10	humble yourselves in the sight of the lord  and he shall lift you up  
11 	speak not evil one of another  brethren  he that speaketh evil of  his  brother  and judgeth his brother  speaketh evil of the law  and judgeth the law  but if thou judge the law  thou art not a doer of the law  but a judge  
12	there is one lawgiver  who is able to save and to destroy  who art thou that judgest another  
13	go to now  ye that say  to day or to morrow we will go into such a city  and continue there a year  and buy and sell  and get gain  
14	whereas ye know not what  shall be  on the morrow  for what  is  your life  it is even a vapour  that appeareth for a little time  and then vanisheth away  
15	for that ye  ought  to say  if the lord will  we shall live  and do this  or that  
16	but now ye rejoice in your boastings  all such rejoicing is evil  
17	therefore to him that knoweth to do good  and doeth  it  not  to him it is sin  
james 5
1 	go to now   ye  rich men  weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon  you   
2	your riches are corrupted  and your garments are motheaten  
3	your gold and silver is cankered  and the rust of them shall be a witness against you  and shall eat your flesh as it were fire  ye have heaped treasure together for the last days  
4	behold  the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields  which is of you kept back by fraud  crieth  and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth  
5	ye have lived in pleasure on the earth  and been wanton  ye have nourished your hearts  as in a day of slaughter  
6	ye have condemned  and  killed the just   and  he doth not resist you  
7	be patient therefore  brethren  unto the coming of the lord  behold  the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth  and hath long patience for it  until he receive the early and latter rain  
8	be ye also patient  stablish your hearts  for the coming of the lord draweth nigh  
9	grudge not one against another  brethren  lest ye be condemned  behold  the judge standeth before the door  
10	take  my brethren  the prophets  who have spoken in the name of the lord  for an example of suffering affliction  and of patience  
11	behold  we count them happy which endure  ye have heard of the patience of job  and have seen the end of the lord  that the lord is very pitiful  and of tender mercy  
12 	but above all things  my brethren  swear not  neither by heaven  neither by the earth  neither by any other oath  but let your yea be yea  and  your  nay  nay  lest ye fall into condemnation  
13	is any among you afflicted  let him pray  is any merry  let him sing psalms  
14	is any sick among you  let him call for the elders of the church  and let them pray over him  anointing him with oil in the name of the lord  
15	and the prayer of faith shall save the sick  and the lord shall raise him up  and if he have committed sins  they shall be forgiven him  
16	confess  your  faults one to another  and pray one for another  that ye may be healed  the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much  
17	elias was a man subject to like passions as we are  and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain  and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months  
18	and he prayed again  and the heaven gave rain  and the earth brought forth her fruit  
19	brethren  if any of you do err from the truth  and one convert him  
20	let him know  that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death  and shall hide a multitude of sins

1 	peter  an apostle of jesus christ  to the strangers scattered throughout pontus  galatia  cappadocia  asia  and bithynia  
2	elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father  through sanctification of the spirit  unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ  grace unto you  and peace  be multiplied  
3 	blessed  be  the god and father of our lord jesus christ  which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead  
4	to an inheritance incorruptible  and undefiled  and that fadeth not away  reserved in heaven for you  
5	who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time  
6 	wherein ye greatly rejoice  though now for a season  if need be  ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations  
7	that the trial of your faith  being much more precious than of gold that perisheth  though it be tried with fire  might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ  
8	whom having not seen  ye love  in whom  though now ye see  him  not  yet believing  ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory  
9	receiving the end of your faith   even  the salvation of  your  souls  
10 	of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently  who prophesied of the grace  that should come  unto you  
11	searching what  or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify  when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ  and the glory that should follow  
12	unto whom it was revealed  that not unto themselves  but unto us they did minister the things  which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven  which things the angels desire to look into  
13 	wherefore gird up the loins of your mind  be sober  and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ  
14	as obedient children  not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance  
15	but as he which hath called you is holy  so be ye holy in all manner of conversation  
16	because it is written  be ye holy  for i am holy  
17	and if ye call on the father  who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man s work  pass the time of your sojourning  here  in fear  
18	forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things   as  silver and gold  from your vain conversation  received  by tradition from your fathers  
19	but with the precious blood of christ  as of a lamb without blemish and without spot  
20	who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world  but was manifest in these last times for you  
21	who by him do believe in god  that raised him up from the dead  and gave him glory  that your faith and hope might be in god  
22	seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren   see that ye  love one another with a pure heart fervently  
23	being born again  not of corruptible seed  but of incorruptible  by the word of god  which liveth and abideth for ever  
24 	for all flesh  is  as grass  and all the glory of man as the flower of grass  the grass withereth  and the flower thereof falleth away  
25	but the word of the lord endureth for ever  and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you  
1 peter 2
1 	wherefore laying aside all malice  and all guile  and hypocrisies  and envies  and all evil speakings  
2	as newborn babes  desire the sincere milk of the word  that ye may grow thereby  
3	if so be ye have tasted that the lord  is  gracious  
4 	to whom coming   as unto  a living stone  disallowed indeed of men  but chosen of god   and  precious  
5	ye also  as lively stones  are built up a spiritual house  an holy priesthood  to offer up spiritual sacrifices  acceptable to god by jesus christ  
6	wherefore also it is contained in the scripture  behold  i lay in sion a chief corner stone  elect  precious  and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded  
7	unto you therefore which believe  he is  precious  but unto them which be disobedient  the stone which the builders disallowed  the same is made the head of the corner  
8	and a stone of stumbling  and a rock of offence   even to them  which stumble at the word  being disobedient  whereunto also they were appointed  
9	but ye  are  a chosen generation  a royal priesthood  an holy nation  a peculiar people  that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light  
10	which in time past  were  not a people  but  are  now the people of god  which had not obtained mercy  but now have obtained mercy  
11	dearly beloved  i beseech  you  as strangers and pilgrims  abstain from fleshly lusts  which war against the soul  
12	having your conversation honest among the gentiles  that  whereas they speak against you as evildoers  they may by  your  good works  which they shall behold  glorify god in the day of visitation  
13 	submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord s sake  whether it be to the king  as supreme  
14	or unto governors  as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers  and for the praise of them that do well  
15	for so is the will of god  that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men  
16	as free  and not using  your  liberty for a cloke of maliciousness  but as the servants of god  
17	honour all  men   love the brotherhood  fear god  honour the king  
18	servants   be  subject to  your  masters with all fear  not only to the good and gentle  but also to the froward  
19	for this  is  thankworthy  if a man for conscience toward god endure grief  suffering wrongfully  
20	for what glory  is it   if  when ye be buffeted for your faults  ye shall take it patiently  but if  when ye do well  and suffer  for it   ye take it patiently  this  is  acceptable with god  
21	for even hereunto were ye called  because christ also suffered for us  leaving us an example  that ye should follow his steps  
22	who did no sin  neither was guile found in his mouth  
23	who  when he was reviled  reviled not again  when he suffered  he threatened not  but committed  himself  to him that judgeth righteously  
24	who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree  that we  being dead to sins  should live unto righteousness  by whose stripes ye were healed  
25	for ye were as sheep going astray  but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls  
1 peter 3
1 	likewise  ye wives   be  in subjection to your own husbands  that  if any obey not the word  they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives  
2	while they behold your chaste conversation  coupled  with fear  
3	whose adorning let it not be that outward  adorning  of plaiting the hair  and of wearing of gold  or of putting on of apparel  
4	but  let it be  the hidden man of the heart  in that which is not corruptible   even the ornament  of a meek and quiet spirit  which is in the sight of god of great price  
5	for after this manner in the old time the holy women also  who trusted in god  adorned themselves  being in subjection unto their own husbands  
6	even as sara obeyed abraham  calling him lord  whose daughters ye are  as long as ye do well  and are not afraid with any amazement  
7	likewise  ye husbands  dwell with  them  according to knowledge  giving honour unto the wife  as unto the weaker vessel  and as being heirs together of the grace of life  that your prayers be not hindered  
8 	finally   be ye  all of one mind  having compassion one of another  love as brethren   be  pitiful   be  courteous  
9	not rendering evil for evil  or railing for railing  but contrariwise blessing  knowing that ye are thereunto called  that ye should inherit a blessing  
10	for he that will love life  and see good days  let him refrain his tongue from evil  and his lips that they speak no guile  
11	let him eschew evil  and do good  let him seek peace  and ensue it  
12	for the eyes of the lord  are  over the righteous  and his ears  are open  unto their prayers  but the face of the lord  is  against them that do evil  
13	and who  is  he that will harm you  if ye be followers of that which is good  
14	but and if ye suffer for righteousness  sake  happy  are ye   and be not afraid of their terror  neither be troubled  
15	but sanctify the lord god in your hearts  and  be  ready always to  give  an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear  
16 	having a good conscience  that  whereas they speak evil of you  as of evildoers  they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ  
17	for  it is  better  if the will of god be so  that ye suffer for well doing  than for evil doing  
18 	for christ also hath once suffered for sins  the just for the unjust  that he might bring us to god  being put to death in the flesh  but quickened by the spirit  
19	by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison  
20	which sometime were disobedient  when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah  while the ark was a preparing  wherein few  that is  eight souls were saved by water  
21 	the like figure whereunto  even  baptism doth also now save us  not the putting away of the filth of the flesh  but the answer of a good conscience toward god   by the resurrection of jesus christ  
22	who is gone into heaven  and is on the right hand of god  angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him  
1 peter 4
1 	forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh  arm yourselves likewise with the same mind  for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin  
2	that he no longer should live the rest of  his  time in the flesh to the lusts of men  but to the will of god  
3	for the time past of  our  life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles  when we walked in lasciviousness  lusts  excess of wine  revellings  banquetings  and abominable idolatries  
4 	wherein they think it strange that ye run not with  them  to the same excess of riot  speaking evil of  you   
5	who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead  
6	for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead  that they might be judged according to men in the flesh  but live according to god in the spirit  
7 	but the end of all things is at hand  be ye therefore sober  and watch unto prayer  
8	and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves  for charity shall cover the multitude of sins  
9	use hospitality one to another without grudging  
10	as every man hath received the gift   even so  minister the same one to another  as good stewards of the manifold grace of god  
11	if any man speak   let him speak  as the oracles of god  if any man minister   let him do it  as of the ability which god giveth  that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ  to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever  amen  
12 	beloved  think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you  as though some strange thing happened unto you  
13	but rejoice  inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ s sufferings  that  when his glory shall be revealed  ye may be glad also with exceeding joy  
14	if ye be reproached for the name of christ  happy  are ye   for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you  on their part he is evil spoken of  but on your part he is glorified  
15	but let none of you suffer as a murderer  or  as  a thief  or  as  an evildoer  or as a busybody in other men s matters  
16	yet if  any man suffer  as a christian  let him not be ashamed  but let him glorify god on this behalf  
17	for the time  is come  that judgment must begin at the house of god  and if  it  first  begin  at us  what shall the end  be  of them that obey not the gospel of god  
18	and if the righteous scarcely be saved  where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear  
19	wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls  to him  in well doing  as unto a faithful creator  
1 peter 5
1 	the elders which are among you i exhort  who am also an elder  and a witness of the sufferings of christ  and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed  
2	feed the flock of god which is among you  taking the oversight  thereof   not by constraint  but willingly  not for filthy lucre  but of a ready mind  
3	neither as being lords over  god s  heritage  but being ensamples to the flock  
4	and when the chief shepherd shall appear  ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away  
5 	likewise  ye younger  submit yourselves unto the elder  yea  all  of you  be subject one to another  and be clothed with humility  for god resisteth the proud  and giveth grace to the humble  
6	humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god  that he may exalt you in due time  
7	casting all your care upon him  for he careth for you  
8 	be sober  be vigilant  because your adversary the devil  as a roaring lion  walketh about  seeking whom he may devour  
9	whom resist stedfast in the faith  knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world  
10 	but the god of all grace  who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus  after that ye have suffered a while  make you perfect  stablish  strengthen  settle  you   
11	to him  be  glory and dominion for ever and ever  amen  
12	by silvanus  a faithful brother unto you  as i suppose  i have written briefly  exhorting  and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand  
13	the  church that is  at babylon  elected together with  you   saluteth you  and  so doth  marcus my son  
14	greet ye one another with a kiss of charity  peace  be  with you all that are in christ jesus  amen  

2 peter
2 peter 1
1 	simon peter  a servant and an apostle of jesus christ  to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ  
2	grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god  and of jesus our lord  
3	according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that  pertain  unto life and godliness  through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue  
4	whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises  that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature  having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust  
5 	and beside this  giving all diligence  add to your faith virtue  and to virtue knowledge  
6	and to knowledge temperance  and to temperance patience  and to patience godliness  
7	and to godliness brotherly kindness  and to brotherly kindness charity  
8	for if these things be in you  and abound  they make  you that ye shall  neither  be  barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ  
9	but he that lacketh these things is blind  and cannot see afar off  and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins  
10	wherefore the rather  brethren  give diligence to make your calling and election sure  for if ye do these things  ye shall never fall  
11	for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ  
12 	wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things  though ye know  them   and be established in the present truth  
13	yea  i think it meet  as long as i am in this tabernacle  to stir you up by putting  you  in remembrance  
14	knowing that shortly i must put off  this  my tabernacle  even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me  
15	moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance  
16 	for we have not followed cunningly devised fables  when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ  but were eyewitnesses of his majesty  
17	for he received from god the father honour and glory  when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory  this is my beloved son  in whom i am well pleased  
18	and this voice which came from heaven we heard  when we were with him in the holy mount  
19 	we have also a more sure word of prophecy  whereunto ye do well that ye take heed  as unto a light that shineth in a dark place  until the day dawn  and the day star arise in your hearts  
20	knowing this first  that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation  
21	for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man  but holy men of god spake  as they were  moved by the holy ghost  
2 peter 2
1 	but there were false prophets also among the people  even as there shall be false teachers among you  who privily shall bring in damnable heresies  even denying the lord that bought them  and bring upon themselves swift destruction  
2	and many shall follow their pernicious ways  by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of  
3 	and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you  whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not  and their damnation slumbereth not  
4	for if god spared not the angels that sinned  but cast  them  down to hell  and delivered  them  into chains of darkness  to be reserved unto judgment  
5	and spared not the old world  but saved noah the eighth  person   a preacher of righteousness  bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly  
6	and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned  them  with an overthrow  making  them  an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly  
7 	and delivered just lot  vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked  
8	 for that righteous man dwelling among them  in seeing and hearing  vexed  his  righteous soul from day to day with  their  unlawful deeds   
9	the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations  and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished  
10 	but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness  and despise government  presumptuous  are they   selfwilled  they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities  
11	whereas angels  which are greater in power and might  bring not railing accusation against them before the lord  
12	but these  as natural brute beasts  made to be taken and destroyed  speak evil of the things that they understand not  and shall utterly perish in their own corruption  
13	and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness   as  they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time  spots  they are  and blemishes  sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you  
14	having eyes full of adultery  and that cannot cease from sin  beguiling unstable souls  an heart they have exercised with covetous practices  cursed children  
15	which have forsaken the right way  and are gone astray  following the way of balaam  the son  of bosor  who loved the wages of unrighteousness  
16	but was rebuked for his iniquity  the dumb ass speaking with man s voice forbad the madness of the prophet  
17	these are wells without water  clouds that are carried with a tempest  to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever  
18	for when they speak great swelling  words  of vanity  they allure through the lusts of the flesh   through much  wantonness  those that were clean escaped from them who live in error  
19	while they promise them liberty  they themselves are the servants of corruption  for of whom a man is overcome  of the same is he brought in bondage  
20	for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ  they are again entangled therein  and overcome  the latter end is worse with them than the beginning  
21	for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness  than  after they have known  it   to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them  
22	but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb  the dog  is  turned to his own vomit again  and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire  
2 peter 3
1 	this second epistle  beloved  i now write unto you  in  both  which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance  
2	that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets  and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour  
3 	knowing this first  that there shall come in the last days scoffers  walking after their own lusts  
4	and saying  where is the promise of his coming  for since the fathers fell asleep  all things continue as  they were  from the beginning of the creation  
5	for this they willingly are ignorant of  that by the word of god the heavens were of old  and the earth standing out of the water and in the water  
6	whereby the world that then was  being overflowed with water  perished  
7	but the heavens and the earth  which are now  by the same word are kept in store  reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men  
8 	but  beloved  be not ignorant of this one thing  that one day  is  with the lord as a thousand years  and a thousand years as one day  
9 	the lord is not slack concerning his promise  as some men count slackness  but is longsuffering to us ward  not willing that any should perish  but that all should come to repentance  
10	but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night  in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise  and the elements shall melt with fervent heat  the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up  
11 	 seeing  then  that  all these things shall be dissolved  what manner  of persons  ought ye to be in  all  holy conversation and godliness  
12	looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god  wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved  and the elements shall melt with fervent heat  
13	nevertheless we  according to his promise  look for new heavens and a new earth  wherein dwelleth righteousness  
14	wherefore  beloved  seeing that ye look for such things  be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace  without spot  and blameless  
15	and account  that  the longsuffering of our lord  is  salvation  even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you  
16	as also in all  his  epistles  speaking in them of these things  in which are some things hard to be understood  which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest  as  they do  also the other scriptures  unto their own destruction  
17	ye therefore  beloved  seeing ye know  these things  before  beware lest ye also  being led away with the error of the wicked  fall from your own stedfastness  
18	but grow in grace  and  in  the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ  to him  be  glory both now and for ever  amen

1 	that which was from the beginning  which we have heard  which we have seen with our eyes  which we have looked upon  and our hands have handled  of the word of life  
2	 for the life was manifested  and we have seen  it   and bear witness  and shew unto you that eternal life  which was with the father  and was manifested unto us   
3	that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you  that ye also may have fellowship with us  and truly our fellowship  is  with the father  and with his son jesus christ  
4	and these things write we unto you  that your joy may be full  
5 	this then is the message which we have heard of him  and declare unto you  that god is light  and in him is no darkness at all  
6	if we say that we have fellowship with him  and walk in darkness  we lie  and do not the truth  
7	but if we walk in the light  as he is in the light  we have fellowship one with another  and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin  
8 	if we say that we have no sin  we deceive ourselves  and the truth is not in us  
9	if we confess our sins  he is faithful and just to forgive us  our  sins  and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  
10	if we say that we have not sinned  we make him a liar  and his word is not in us  
1 john 2
1 	my little children  these things write i unto you  that ye sin not  and if any man sin  we have an advocate with the father  jesus christ the righteous  
2	and he is the propitiation for our sins  and not for ours only  but also for  the sins of  the whole world  
3 	and hereby we do know that we know him  if we keep his commandments  
4	he that saith  i know him  and keepeth not his commandments  is a liar  and the truth is not in him  
5	but whoso keepeth his word  in him verily is the love of god perfected  hereby know we that we are in him  
6	he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk  even as he walked  
7 	brethren  i write no new commandment unto you  but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning  the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning  
8	again  a new commandment i write unto you  which thing is true in him and in you  because the darkness is past  and the true light now shineth  
9	he that saith he is in the light  and hateth his brother  is in darkness even until now  
10	he that loveth his brother abideth in the light  and there is none occasion of stumbling in him  
11	but he that hateth his brother is in darkness  and walketh in darkness  and knoweth not whither he goeth  because that darkness hath blinded his eyes  
12 	i write unto you  little children  because your sins are forgiven you for his name s sake  
13	i write unto you  fathers  because ye have known him  that is  from the beginning  i write unto you  young men  because ye have overcome the wicked one  i write unto you  little children  because ye have known the father  
14	i have written unto you  fathers  because ye have known him  that is  from the beginning  i have written unto you  young men  because ye are strong  and the word of god abideth in you  and ye have overcome the wicked one  
15	love not the world  neither the things  that are  in the world  if any man love the world  the love of the father is not in him  
16	for all that  is  in the world  the lust of the flesh  and the lust of the eyes  and the pride of life  is not of the father  but is of the world  
17	and the world passeth away  and the lust thereof  but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever  
18 	little children  it is the last time  and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come  even now are there many antichrists  whereby we know that it is the last time  
19	they went out from us  but they were not of us  for if they had been of us  they would  no doubt  have continued with us  but  they went out   that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us  
20 	but ye have an unction from the holy one  and ye know all things  
21	i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth  but because ye know it  and that no lie is of the truth  
22	who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ  he is antichrist  that denieth the father and the son  
23	whosoever denieth the son  the same hath not the father    but  he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also   
24	let that therefore abide in you  which ye have heard from the beginning  if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you  ye also shall continue in the son  and in the father  
25	and this is the promise that he hath promised us   even  eternal life  
26	these  things  have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you  
27	but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you  and ye need not that any man teach you  but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things  and is truth  and is no lie  and even as it hath taught you  ye shall abide in him  
28 	and now  little children  abide in him  that  when he shall appear  we may have confidence  and not be ashamed before him at his coming  
29	if ye know that he is righteous  ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him  
1 john 3
1 	behold  what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us  that we should be called the sons of god  therefore the world knoweth us not  because it knew him not  
2	beloved  now are we the sons of god  and it doth not yet appear what we shall be  but we know that  when he shall appear  we shall be like him  for we shall see him as he is  
3	and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself  even as he is pure  
4 	whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law  for sin is the transgression of the law  
5	and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins  and in him is no sin  
6	whosoever abideth in him sinneth not  whosoever sinneth hath not seen him  neither known him  
7	little children  let no man deceive you  he that doeth righteousness is righteous  even as he is righteous  
8	he that committeth sin is of the devil  for the devil sinneth from the beginning  for this purpose the son of god was manifested  that he might destroy the works of the devil  
9	whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin  for his seed remaineth in him  and he cannot sin  because he is born of god  
10	in this the children of god are manifest  and the children of the devil  whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god  neither he that loveth not his brother  
11 	for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning  that we should love one another  
12	not as cain   who  was of that wicked one  and slew his brother  and wherefore slew he him  because his own works were evil  and his brother s righteous  
13	marvel not  my brethren  if the world hate you  
14 	we know that we have passed from death unto life  because we love the brethren  he that loveth not  his  brother abideth in death  
15	whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer  and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him  
16	hereby perceive we the love  of god   because he laid down his life for us  and we ought to lay down  our  lives for the brethren  
17	but whoso hath this world s good  and seeth his brother have need  and shutteth up his bowels  of compassion  from him  how dwelleth the love of god in him  
18	my little children  let us not love in word  neither in tongue  but in deed and in truth  
19	and hereby we know that we are of the truth  and shall assure our hearts before him  
20 	for if our heart condemn us  god is greater than our heart  and knoweth all things  
21	beloved  if our heart condemn us not   then  have we confidence toward god  
22	and whatsoever we ask  we receive of him  because we keep his commandments  and do those things that are pleasing in his sight  
23 	and this is his commandment  that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ  and love one another  as he gave us commandment  
24	and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him  and he in him  and hereby we know that he abideth in us  by the spirit which he hath given us  
1 john 4
1 	beloved  believe not every spirit  but try the spirits whether they are of god  because many false prophets are gone out into the world  
2	hereby know ye the spirit of god  every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god  
3	and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god  and this is that  spirit  of antichrist  whereof ye have heard that it should come  and even now already is it in the world  
4 	ye are of god  little children  and have overcome them  because greater is he that is in you  than he that is in the world  
5	they are of the world  therefore speak they of the world  and the world heareth them  
6	we are of god  he that knoweth god heareth us  he that is not of god heareth not us  hereby know we the spirit of truth  and the spirit of error  
7 	beloved  let us love one another  for love is of god  and every one that loveth is born of god  and knoweth god  
8	he that loveth not knoweth not god  for god is love  
9	in this was manifested the love of god toward us  because that god sent his only begotten son into the world  that we might live through him  
10	herein is love  not that we loved god  but that he loved us  and sent his son  to be  the propitiation for our sins  
11	beloved  if god so loved us  we ought also to love one another  
12	no man hath seen god at any time  if we love one another  god dwelleth in us  and his love is perfected in us  
13	hereby know we that we dwell in him  and he in us  because he hath given us of his spirit  
14 	and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son  to be  the saviour of the world  
15	whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god  god dwelleth in him  and he in god  
16	and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us  god is love  and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god  and god in him  
17 	herein is our love made perfect  that we may have boldness in the day of judgment  because as he is  so are we in this world  
18	there is no fear in love  but perfect love casteth out fear  because fear hath torment  he that feareth is not made perfect in love  
19	we love him  because he first loved us  
20	if a man say  i love god  and hateth his brother  he is a liar  for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen  how can he love god whom he hath not seen  
21	and this commandment have we from him  that he who loveth god love his brother also  
1 john 5
1 	whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god  and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him  
2	by this we know that we love the children of god  when we love god  and keep his commandments  
3	for this is the love of god  that we keep his commandments  and his commandments are not grievous  
4	for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world  and this is the victory that overcometh the world   even  our faith  
5	who is he that overcometh the world  but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god  
6 	this is he that came by water and blood   even  jesus christ  not by water only  but by water and blood  and it is the spirit that beareth witness  because the spirit is truth  
7	for there are three that bear record in heaven  the father  the word  and the holy ghost  and these three are one  
8	and there are three that bear witness in earth  the spirit  and the water  and the blood  and these three agree in one  
9	if we receive the witness of men  the witness of god is greater  for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son  
10 	he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself  he that believeth not god hath made him a liar  because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son  
11	and this is the record  that god hath given to us eternal life  and this life is in his son  
12	he that hath the son hath life   and  he that hath not the son of god hath not life  
13	these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god  that ye may know that ye have eternal life  and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god  
14 	and this is the confidence that we have in him  that  if we ask any thing according to his will  he heareth us  
15	and if we know that he hear us  whatsoever we ask  we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him  
16	if any man see his brother sin a sin  which is  not unto death  he shall ask  and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death  there is a sin unto death  i do not say that he shall pray for it  
17	all unrighteousness is sin  and there is a sin not unto death  
18 	we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not  but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself  and that wicked one toucheth him not  
19	 and  we know that we are of god  and the whole world lieth in wickedness  
20	and we know that the son of god is come  and hath given us an understanding  that we may know him that is true  and we are in him that is true   even  in his son jesus christ  this is the true god  and eternal life  
21	little children  keep yourselves from idols  amen

4	i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth  as we have received a commandment from the father  
5 	and now i beseech thee  lady  not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee  but that which we had from the beginning  that we love one another  
6	and this is love  that we walk after his commandments  this is the commandment  that  as ye have heard from the beginning  ye should walk in it  
7 	for many deceivers are entered into the world  who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh  this is a deceiver and an antichrist  
8	look to yourselves  that we lose not those things which we have wrought  but that we receive a full reward  
9	whosoever transgresseth  and abideth not in the doctrine of christ  hath not god  he that abideth in the doctrine of christ  he hath both the father and the son

11	for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds

3 	for i rejoiced greatly  when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee  even as thou walkest in the truth  
4	i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth  
5	beloved  thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren  and to strangers  
6	which have borne witness of thy charity before the church  whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort  thou shalt do well  
7	because that for his name s sake they went forth  taking nothing of the gentiles  
8	we therefore ought to receive such  that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth  
9 	i wrote unto the church  but diotrephes  who loveth to have the preeminence among them  receiveth us not  
10	wherefore  if i come  i will remember his deeds which he doeth  prating against us with malicious words  and not content therewith  neither doth he himself receive the brethren  and forbiddeth them that would  and casteth  them  out of the church  
11	beloved  follow not that which is evil  but that which is good  he that doeth good is of god  but he that doeth evil hath not seen god

4	for there are certain men crept in unawares  who were before of old ordained to this condemnation  ungodly men  turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness  and denying the only lord god  and our lord jesus christ  
5	i will therefore put you in remembrance  though ye once knew this  how that the lord  having saved the people out of the land of egypt  afterward destroyed them that believed not  
6	and the angels which kept not their first estate  but left their own habitation  he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day  
7	even as sodom and gomorrha  and the cities about them in like manner  giving themselves over to fornication  and going after strange flesh  are set forth for an example  suffering the vengeance of eternal fire  
8 	likewise also these  filthy  dreamers defile the flesh  despise dominion  and speak evil of dignities  
9	yet michael the archangel  when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses  durst not bring against him a railing accusation  but said  the lord rebuke thee  
10	but these speak evil of those things which they know not  but what they know naturally  as brute beasts  in those things they corrupt themselves  
11	woe unto them  for they have gone in the way of cain  and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward  and perished in the gainsaying of core  
12	these are spots in your feasts of charity  when they feast with you  feeding themselves without fear  clouds  they are  without water  carried about of winds  trees whose fruit withereth  without fruit  twice dead  plucked up by the roots  
13	raging waves of the sea  foaming out their own shame  wandering stars  to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever  
14	and enoch also  the seventh from adam  prophesied of these  saying  behold  the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints  
15 	to execute judgment upon all  and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed  and of all their hard  speeches  which ungodly sinners have spoken against him  
16	these are murmurers  complainers  walking after their own lusts  and their mouth speaketh great swelling  words   having men s persons in admiration because of advantage  
17	but  beloved  remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ  
18	how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time  who should walk after their own ungodly lusts  
19	these be they who separate themselves  sensual  having not the spirit  
20	but ye  beloved  building up yourselves on your most holy faith  praying in the holy ghost  
21	keep yourselves in the love of god  looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life  
22	and of some have compassion  making a difference  
23	and others save with fear  pulling  them  out of the fire  hating even the garment spotted by the flesh  
24	now unto him that is able to keep you from falling  and to present  you  faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy  
25	to the only wise god our saviour   be  glory and majesty  dominion and power  both now and ever  amen

revelation 1
1 	the revelation of jesus christ  which god gave unto him  to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass  and he sent and signified  it  by his angel unto his servant john  
2	who bare record of the word of god  and of the testimony of jesus christ  and of all things that he saw  
3 	blessed  is  he that readeth  and they that hear the words of this prophecy  and keep those things which are written therein  for the time  is  at hand  
4	john to the seven churches which are in asia  grace  be  unto you  and peace  from him which is  and which was  and which is to come  and from the seven spirits which are before his throne  
5	and from jesus christ   who is  the faithful witness   and  the first begotten of the dead  and the prince of the kings of the earth  unto him that loved us  and washed us from our sins in his own blood  
6	and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father  to him  be  glory and dominion for ever and ever  amen  
7	behold  he cometh with clouds  and every eye shall see him  and they  also  which pierced him  and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him  even so  amen  
8	i am alpha and omega  the beginning and the ending  saith the lord  which is  and which was  and which is to come  the almighty  
9 	i john  who also am your brother  and companion in tribulation  and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ  was in the isle that is called patmos  for the word of god  and for the testimony of jesus christ  
10	i was in the spirit on the lord s day  and heard behind me a great voice  as of a trumpet  
11	saying  i am alpha and omega  the first and the last  and  what thou seest  write in a book  and send  it  unto the seven churches which are in asia  unto ephesus  and unto smyrna  and unto pergamos  and unto thyatira  and unto sardis  and unto philadelphia  and unto laodicea  
12	and i turned to see the voice that spake with me  and being turned  i saw seven golden candlesticks  
13	and in the midst of the seven candlesticks  one  like unto the son of man  clothed with a garment down to the foot  and girt about the paps with a golden girdle  
14	his head and  his  hairs  were  white like wool  as white as snow  and his eyes  were  as a flame of fire  
15	and his feet like unto fine brass  as if they burned in a furnace  and his voice as the sound of many waters  
16	and he had in his right hand seven stars  and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword  and his countenance  was  as the sun shineth in his strength  
17	and when i saw him  i fell at his feet as dead  and he laid his right hand upon me  saying unto me  fear not  i am the first and the last  
18	i  am  he that liveth  and was dead  and  behold  i am alive for evermore  amen  and have the keys of hell and of death  
19	write the things which thou hast seen  and the things which are  and the things which shall be hereafter  
20	the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand  and the seven golden candlesticks  the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches  and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches  
revelation 2
1 	unto the angel of the church of ephesus write  these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand  who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks  
2	i know thy works  and thy labour  and thy patience  and how thou canst not bear them which are evil  and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles  and are not  and hast found them liars  
3	and hast borne  and hast patience  and for my name s sake hast laboured  and hast not fainted  
4	nevertheless i have  somewhat  against thee  because thou hast left thy first love  
5	remember therefore from whence thou art fallen  and repent  and do the first works  or else i will come unto thee quickly  and will remove thy candlestick out of his place  except thou repent  
6	but this thou hast  that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans  which i also hate  
7	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life  which is in the midst of the paradise of god  
8 	and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write  these things saith the first and the last  which was dead  and is alive  
9	i know thy works  and tribulation  and poverty   but thou art rich  and  i know  the blasphemy of them which say they are jews  and are not  but  are  the synagogue of satan  
10	fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer  behold  the devil shall cast  some  of you into prison  that ye may be tried  and ye shall have tribulation ten days  be thou faithful unto death  and i will give thee a crown of life  
11	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death  
12 	and to the angel of the church in pergamos write  these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges  
13	i know thy works  and where thou dwellest   even  where satan s seat  is   and thou holdest fast my name  and hast not denied my faith  even in those days wherein antipas  was  my faithful martyr  who was slain among you  where satan dwelleth  
14	but i have a few things against thee  because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam  who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel  to eat things sacrificed unto idols  and to commit fornication  
15	so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans  which thing i hate  
16	repent  or else i will come unto thee quickly  and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth  
17	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna  and will give him a white stone  and in the stone a new name written  which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth  it   
18 	and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write  these things saith the son of god  who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire  and his feet  are  like fine brass  
19	i know thy works  and charity  and service  and faith  and thy patience  and thy works  and the last  to be  more than the first  
20	notwithstanding i have a few things against thee  because thou sufferest that woman jezebel  which calleth herself a prophetess  to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication  and to eat things sacrificed unto idols  
21	and i gave her space to repent of her fornication  and she repented not  
22	behold  i will cast her into a bed  and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation  except they repent of their deeds  
23	and i will kill her children with death  and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts  and i will give unto every one of you according to your works  
24	but unto you i say  and unto the rest in thyatira  as many as have not this doctrine  and which have not known the depths of satan  as they speak  i will put upon you none other burden  
25	but that which ye have  already  hold fast till i come  
26	and he that overcometh  and keepeth my works unto the end  to him will i give power over the nations  
27	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron  as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers  even as i received of my father  
28	and i will give him the morning star  
29	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  
revelation 3
1 	and unto the angel of the church in sardis write  these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god  and the seven stars  i know thy works  that thou hast a name that thou livest  and art dead  
2	be watchful  and strengthen the things which remain  that are ready to die  for i have not found thy works perfect before god  
3	remember therefore how thou hast received and heard  and hold fast  and repent  if therefore thou shalt not watch  i will come on thee as a thief  and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee  
4	thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments  and they shall walk with me in white  for they are worthy  
5	he that overcometh  the same shall be clothed in white raiment  and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life  but i will confess his name before my father  and before his angels  
6	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  
7 	and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write  these things saith he that is holy  he that is true  he that hath the key of david  he that openeth  and no man shutteth  and shutteth  and no man openeth  
8	i know thy works  behold  i have set before thee an open door  and no man can shut it  for thou hast a little strength  and hast kept my word  and hast not denied my name  
9	behold  i will make them of the synagogue of satan  which say they are jews  and are not  but do lie  behold  i will make them to come and worship before thy feet  and to know that i have loved thee  
10	because thou hast kept the word of my patience  i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation  which shall come upon all the world  to try them that dwell upon the earth  
11	behold  i come quickly  hold that fast which thou hast  that no man take thy crown  
12	him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god  and he shall go no more out  and i will write upon him the name of my god  and the name of the city of my god   which is  new jerusalem  which cometh down out of heaven from my god  and  i will write upon him  my new name  
13	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  
14 	and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write  these things saith the amen  the faithful and true witness  the beginning of the creation of god  
15	i know thy works  that thou art neither cold nor hot  i would thou wert cold or hot  
16	so then because thou art lukewarm  and neither cold nor hot  i will spue thee out of my mouth  
17	because thou sayest  i am rich  and increased with goods  and have need of nothing  and knowest not that thou art wretched  and miserable  and poor  and blind  and naked  
18	i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire  that thou mayest be rich  and white raiment  that thou mayest be clothed  and  that  the shame of thy nakedness do not appear  and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve  that thou mayest see  
19	as many as i love  i rebuke and chasten  be zealous therefore  and repent  
20	behold  i stand at the door  and knock  if any man hear my voice  and open the door  i will come in to him  and will sup with him  and he with me  
21	to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne  even as i also overcame  and am set down with my father in his throne  
22	he that hath an ear  let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches  
revelation 4
1 	after this i looked  and  behold  a door  was  opened in heaven  and the first voice which i heard  was  as it were of a trumpet talking with me  which said  come up hither  and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter  
2	and immediately i was in the spirit  and  behold  a throne was set in heaven  and  one  sat on the throne  
3	and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone  and  there was  a rainbow round about the throne  in sight like unto an emerald  
4	and round about the throne  were  four and twenty seats  and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting  clothed in white raiment  and they had on their heads crowns of gold  
5	and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices  and  there were  seven lamps of fire burning before the throne  which are the seven spirits of god  
6	and before the throne  there was  a sea of glass like unto crystal  and in the midst of the throne  and round about the throne   were  four beasts full of eyes before and behind  
7	and the first beast  was  like a lion  and the second beast like a calf  and the third beast had a face as a man  and the fourth beast  was  like a flying eagle  
8 	and the four beasts had each of them six wings about  him   and  they were  full of eyes within  and they rest not day and night  saying  holy  holy  holy  lord god almighty  which was  and is  and is to come  
9	and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne  who liveth for ever and ever  
10	the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne  and worship him that liveth for ever and ever  and cast their crowns before the throne  saying  
11	thou art worthy  o lord  to receive glory and honour and power  for thou hast created all things  and for thy pleasure they are and were created  
revelation 5
1 	and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside  sealed with seven seals  
2	and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice  who is worthy to open the book  and to loose the seals thereof  
3	and no man in heaven  nor in earth  neither under the earth  was able to open the book  neither to look thereon  
4	and i wept much  because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book  neither to look thereon  
5	and one of the elders saith unto me  weep not  behold  the lion of the tribe of juda  the root of david  hath prevailed to open the book  and to loose the seven seals thereof  
6 	and i beheld  and  lo  in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts  and in the midst of the elders  stood a lamb as it had been slain  having seven horns and seven eyes  which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth  
7	and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne  
8	and when he had taken the book  the four beasts and four  and  twenty elders fell down before the lamb  having every one of them harps  and golden vials full of odours  which are the prayers of saints  
9	and they sung a new song  saying  thou art worthy to take the book  and to open the seals thereof  for thou wast slain  and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred  and tongue  and people  and nation  
10	and hast made us unto our god kings and priests  and we shall reign on the earth  
11	and i beheld  and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders  and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand  and thousands of thousands  
12	saying with a loud voice  worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power  and riches  and wisdom  and strength  and honour  and glory  and blessing  
13	and every creature which is in heaven  and on the earth  and under the earth  and such as are in the sea  and all that are in them  heard i saying  blessing  and honour  and glory  and power   be  unto him that sitteth upon the throne  and unto the lamb for ever and ever  
14	and the four beasts said  amen  and the four  and  twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever  
revelation 6
1 	and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals  and i heard  as it were the noise of thunder  one of the four beasts saying  come and see  
2	and i saw  and behold a white horse  and he that sat on him had a bow  and a crown was given unto him  and he went forth conquering  and to conquer  
3 	and when he had opened the second seal  i heard the second beast say  come and see  
4	and there went out another horse  that was  red  and  power  was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth  and that they should kill one another  and there was given unto him a great sword  
5	and when he had opened the third seal  i heard the third beast say  come and see  and i beheld  and lo a black horse  and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand  
6	and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say  a measure of wheat for a penny  and three measures of barley for a penny  and  see  thou hurt not the oil and the wine  
7	and when he had opened the fourth seal  i heard the voice of the fourth beast say  come and see  
8	and i looked  and behold a pale horse  and his name that sat on him was death  and hell followed with him  and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth  to kill with sword  and with hunger  and with death  and with the beasts of the earth  
9 	and when he had opened the fifth seal  i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god  and for the testimony which they held  
10	and they cried with a loud voice  saying  how long  o lord  holy and true  dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth  
11	and white robes were given unto every one of them  and it was said unto them  that they should rest yet for a little season  until their fellowservants also and their brethren  that should be killed as they  were   should be fulfilled  
12	and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal  and  lo  there was a great earthquake  and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair  and the moon became as blood  
13	and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth  even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs  when she is shaken of a mighty wind  
14	and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together  and every mountain and island were moved out of their places  
15	and the kings of the earth  and the great men  and the rich men  and the chief captains  and the mighty men  and every bondman  and every free man  hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains  
16	and said to the mountains and rocks  fall on us  and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne  and from the wrath of the lamb  
17	for the great day of his wrath is come  and who shall be able to stand  
revelation 7
1 	and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth  holding the four winds of the earth  that the wind should not blow on the earth  nor on the sea  nor on any tree  
2	and i saw another angel ascending from the east  having the seal of the living god  and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels  to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea  
3	saying  hurt not the earth  neither the sea  nor the trees  till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads  
4	and i heard the number of them which were sealed   and there were  sealed an hundred  and  forty  and  four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel  
5	of the tribe of juda  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of reuben  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of gad  were  sealed twelve thousand  
6	of the tribe of aser  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of nepthalim  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of manasses  were  sealed twelve thousand  
7	of the tribe of simeon  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of levi  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of issachar  were  sealed twelve thousand  
8	of the tribe of zabulon  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of joseph  were  sealed twelve thousand  of the tribe of benjamin  were  sealed twelve thousand  
9	after this i beheld  and  lo  a great multitude  which no man could number  of all nations  and kindreds  and people  and tongues  stood before the throne  and before the lamb  clothed with white robes  and palms in their hands  
10	and cried with a loud voice  saying  salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne  and unto the lamb  
11	and all the angels stood round about the throne  and  about  the elders and the four beasts  and fell before the throne on their faces  and worshipped god  
12	saying  amen  blessing  and glory  and wisdom  and thanksgiving  and honour  and power  and might   be  unto our god for ever and ever  amen  
13 	and one of the elders answered  saying unto me  what are these which are arrayed in white robes  and whence came they  
14	and i said unto him  sir  thou knowest  and he said to me  these are they which came out of great tribulation  and have washed their robes  and made them white in the blood of the lamb  
15	therefore are they before the throne of god  and serve him day and night in his temple  and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them  
16	they shall hunger no more  neither thirst any more  neither shall the sun light on them  nor any heat  
17	for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them  and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters  and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes  
revelation 8
1 	and when he had opened the seventh seal  there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour  
2	and i saw the seven angels which stood before god  and to them were given seven trumpets  
3	and another angel came and stood at the altar  having a golden censer  and there was given unto him much incense  that he should offer  it  with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne  
4	and the smoke of the incense   which came  with the prayers of the saints  ascended up before god out of the angel s hand  
5	and the angel took the censer  and filled it with fire of the altar  and cast  it  into the earth  and there were voices  and thunderings  and lightnings  and an earthquake  
6	and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound  
7 	the first angel sounded  and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood  and they were cast upon the earth  and the third part of trees was burnt up  and all green grass was burnt up  
8	and the second angel sounded  and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea  and the third part of the sea became blood  
9	and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea  and had life  died  and the third part of the ships were destroyed  
10	and the third angel sounded  and there fell a great star from heaven  burning as it were a lamp  and it fell upon the third part of the rivers  and upon the fountains of waters  
11	and the name of the star is called wormwood  and the third part of the waters became wormwood  and many men died of the waters  because they were made bitter  
12	and the fourth angel sounded  and the third part of the sun was smitten  and the third part of the moon  and the third part of the stars  so as the third part of them was darkened  and the day shone not for a third part of it  and the night likewise  
13	and i beheld  and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven  saying with a loud voice  woe  woe  woe  to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels  which are yet to sound  
revelation 9
1 	and the fifth angel sounded  and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth  and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit  
2	and he opened the bottomless pit  and there arose a smoke out of the pit  as the smoke of a great furnace  and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit  
3	and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth  and unto them was given power  as the scorpions of the earth have power  
4	and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth  neither any green thing  neither any tree  but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads  
5	and to them it was given that they should not kill them  but that they should be tormented five months  and their torment  was  as the torment of a scorpion  when he striketh a man  
6	and in those days shall men seek death  and shall not find it  and shall desire to die  and death shall flee from them  
7	and the shapes of the locusts  were  like unto horses prepared unto battle  and on their heads  were  as it were crowns like gold  and their faces  were  as the faces of men  
8	and they had hair as the hair of women  and their teeth were as  the teeth  of lions  
9	and they had breastplates  as it were breastplates of iron  and the sound of their wings  was  as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle  
10	and they had tails like unto scorpions  and there were stings in their tails  and their power  was  to hurt men five months  
11	and they had a king over them   which is  the angel of the bottomless pit  whose name in the hebrew tongue  is  abaddon  but in the greek tongue hath  his  name apollyon  
12	one woe is past   and   behold  there come two woes more hereafter  
13 	and the sixth angel sounded  and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god  
14	saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet  loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates  
15	and the four angels were loosed  which were prepared for an hour  and a day  and a month  and a year  for to slay the third part of men  
16	and the number of the army of the horsemen  were  two hundred thousand thousand  and i heard the number of them  
17	and thus i saw the horses in the vision  and them that sat on them  having breastplates of fire  and of jacinth  and brimstone  and the heads of the horses  were  as the heads of lions  and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone  
18	by these three was the third part of men killed  by the fire  and by the smoke  and by the brimstone  which issued out of their mouths  
19	for their power is in their mouth  and in their tails  for their tails  were  like unto serpents  and had heads  and with them they do hurt  
20	and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands  that they should not worship devils  and idols of gold  and silver  and brass  and stone  and of wood  which neither can see  nor hear  nor walk  
21	neither repented they of their murders  nor of their sorceries  nor of their fornication  nor of their thefts  
revelation 10
1 	and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven  clothed with a cloud  and a rainbow  was  upon his head  and his face  was  as it were the sun  and his feet as pillars of fire  
2	and he had in his hand a little book open  and he set his right foot upon the sea  and  his  left  foot  on the earth  
3	and cried with a loud voice  as  when  a lion roareth  and when he had cried  seven thunders uttered their voices  
4	and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices  i was about to write  and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me  seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered  and write them not  
5	and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven  
6	and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever  who created heaven  and the things that therein are  and the earth  and the things that therein are  and the sea  and the things which are therein  that there should be time no longer  
7	but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel  when he shall begin to sound  the mystery of god should be finished  as he hath declared to his servants the prophets  
8 	and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again  and said  go  and  take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth  
9	and i went unto the angel  and said unto him  give me the little book  and he said unto me  take  it   and eat it up  and it shall make thy belly bitter  but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey  
10	and i took the little book out of the angel s hand  and ate it up  and it was in my mouth sweet as honey  and as soon as i had eaten it  my belly was bitter  
11	and he said unto me  thou must prophesy again before many peoples  and nations  and tongues  and kings  
revelation 11
1 	and there was given me a reed like unto a rod  and the angel stood  saying  rise  and measure the temple of god  and the altar  and them that worship therein  
2	but the court which is without the temple leave out  and measure it not  for it is given unto the gentiles  and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty  and  two months  
3 	and i will give  power  unto my two witnesses  and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred  and  threescore days  clothed in sackcloth  
4	these are the two olive trees  and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth  
5	and if any man will hurt them  fire proceedeth out of their mouth  and devoureth their enemies  and if any man will hurt them  he must in this manner be killed  
6	these have power to shut heaven  that it rain not in the days of their prophecy  and have power over waters to turn them to blood  and to smite the earth with all plagues  as often as they will  
7	and when they shall have finished their testimony  the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them  and shall overcome them  and kill them  
8	and their dead bodies  shall lie  in the street of the great city  which spiritually is called sodom and egypt  where also our lord was crucified  
9	and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half  and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves  
10	and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them  and make merry  and shall send gifts one to another  because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth  
11	and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them  and they stood upon their feet  and great fear fell upon them which saw them  
12	and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them  come up hither  and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud  and their enemies beheld them  
13	and the same hour was there a great earthquake  and the tenth part of the city fell  and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand  and the remnant were affrighted  and gave glory to the god of heaven  
14 	the second woe is past   and   behold  the third woe cometh quickly  
15	and the seventh angel sounded  and there were great voices in heaven  saying  the kingdoms of this world are become  the kingdoms  of our lord  and of his christ  and he shall reign for ever and ever  
16	and the four and twenty elders  which sat before god on their seats  fell upon their faces  and worshipped god  
17	saying  we give thee thanks  o lord god almighty  which art  and wast  and art to come  because thou hast taken to thee thy great power  and hast reigned  
18	and the nations were angry  and thy wrath is come  and the time of the dead  that they should be judged  and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets  and to the saints  and them that fear thy name  small and great  and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth  
19	and the temple of god was opened in heaven  and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament  and there were lightnings  and voices  and thunderings  and an earthquake  and great hail  
revelation 12
1 	and there appeared a great wonder in heaven  a woman clothed with the sun  and the moon under her feet  and upon her head a crown of twelve stars  
2	and she being with child cried  travailing in birth  and pained to be delivered  
3	and there appeared another wonder in heaven  and behold a great red dragon  having seven heads and ten horns  and seven crowns upon his heads  
4	and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven  and did cast them to the earth  and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered  for to devour her child as soon as it was born  
5	and she brought forth a man child  who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron  and her child was caught up unto god  and  to  his throne  
6	and the woman fled into the wilderness  where she hath a place prepared of god  that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred  and  threescore days  
7	and there was war in heaven  michael and his angels fought against the dragon  and the dragon fought and his angels  
8	and prevailed not  neither was their place found any more in heaven  
9	and the great dragon was cast out  that old serpent  called the devil  and satan  which deceiveth the whole world  he was cast out into the earth  and his angels were cast out with him  
10	and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven  now is come salvation  and strength  and the kingdom of our god  and the power of his christ  for the accuser of our brethren is cast down  which accused them before our god day and night  
11	and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb  and by the word of their testimony  and they loved not their lives unto the death  
12 	therefore rejoice   ye  heavens  and ye that dwell in them  woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea  for the devil is come down unto you  having great wrath  because he knoweth that he hath but a short time  
13	and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth  he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man  child   
14	and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle  that she might fly into the wilderness  into her place  where she is nourished for a time  and times  and half a time  from the face of the serpent  
15	and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman  that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood  
16	and the earth helped the woman  and the earth opened her mouth  and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth  
17	and the dragon was wroth with the woman  and went to make war with the remnant of her seed  which keep the commandments of god  and have the testimony of jesus christ  
revelation 13
1 	and i stood upon the sand of the sea  and saw a beast rise up out of the sea  having seven heads and ten horns  and upon his horns ten crowns  and upon his heads the name of blasphemy  
2	and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard  and his feet were as  the feet  of a bear  and his mouth as the mouth of a lion  and the dragon gave him his power  and his seat  and great authority  
3	and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death  and his deadly wound was healed  and all the world wondered after the beast  
4	and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast  and they worshipped the beast  saying  who  is  like unto the beast  who is able to make war with him  
5	and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies  and power was given unto him to continue forty  and  two months  
6	and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god  to blaspheme his name  and his tabernacle  and them that dwell in heaven  
7	and it was given unto him to make war with the saints  and to overcome them  and power was given him over all kindreds  and tongues  and nations  
8	and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him  whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world  
9	if any man have an ear  let him hear  
10	he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity  he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword  here is the patience and the faith of the saints  
11 	and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth  and he had two horns like a lamb  and he spake as a dragon  
12	and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him  and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast  whose deadly wound was healed  
13	and he doeth great wonders  so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men  
14	and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by  the means of  those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast  saying to them that dwell on the earth  that they should make an image to the beast  which had the wound by a sword  and did live  
15	and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast  that the image of the beast should both speak  and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed  
16	and he causeth all  both small and great  rich and poor  free and bond  to receive a mark in their right hand  or in their foreheads  
17	and that no man might buy or sell  save he that had the mark  or the name of the beast  or the number of his name  
18	here is wisdom  let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast  for it is the number of a man  and his number  is  six hundred threescore  and  six  
revelation 14
1 	and i looked  and  lo  a lamb stood on the mount sion  and with him an hundred forty  and  four thousand  having his father s name written in their foreheads  
2	and i heard a voice from heaven  as the voice of many waters  and as the voice of a great thunder  and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps  
3	and they sung as it were a new song before the throne  and before the four beasts  and the elders  and no man could learn that song but the hundred  and  forty  and  four thousand  which were redeemed from the earth  
4	these are they which were not defiled with women  for they are virgins  these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth  these were redeemed from among men   being  the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb  
5	and in their mouth was found no guile  for they are without fault before the throne of god  
6 	and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven  having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth  and to every nation  and kindred  and tongue  and people  
7	saying with a loud voice  fear god  and give glory to him  for the hour of his judgment is come  and worship him that made heaven  and earth  and the sea  and the fountains of waters  
8	and there followed another angel  saying  babylon is fallen  is fallen  that great city  because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication  
9	and the third angel followed them  saying with a loud voice  if any man worship the beast and his image  and receive  his  mark in his forehead  or in his hand  
10	the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god  which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation  and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels  and in the presence of the lamb  
11	and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever  and they have no rest day nor night  who worship the beast and his image  and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name  
12	here is the patience of the saints  here  are  they that keep the commandments of god  and the faith of jesus  
13 	and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me  write  blessed  are  the dead which die in the lord from henceforth  yea  saith the spirit  that they may rest from their labours  and their works do follow them  
14	and i looked  and behold a white cloud  and upon the cloud  one  sat like unto the son of man  having on his head a golden crown  and in his hand a sharp sickle  
15	and another angel came out of the temple  crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud  thrust in thy sickle  and reap  for the time is come for thee to reap  for the harvest of the earth is ripe  
16	and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth  and the earth was reaped  
17	and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven  he also having a sharp sickle  
18	and another angel came out from the altar  which had power over fire  and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle  saying  thrust in thy sharp sickle  and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth  for her grapes are fully ripe  
19	and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth  and gathered the vine of the earth  and cast  it  into the great winepress of the wrath of god  
20	and the winepress was trodden without the city  and blood came out of the winepress  even unto the horse bridles  by the space of a thousand  and  six hundred furlongs  
revelation 15
1 	and i saw another sign in heaven  great and marvellous  seven angels having the seven last plagues  for in them is filled up the wrath of god  
2	and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire  and them that had gotten the victory over the beast  and over his image  and over his mark   and  over the number of his name  stand on the sea of glass  having the harps of god  
3	and they sing the song of moses the servant of god  and the song of the lamb  saying  great and marvellous  are  thy works  lord god almighty  just and true  are  thy ways  thou king of saints  
4	who shall not fear thee  o lord  and glorify thy name  for  thou  only  art  holy  for all nations shall come and worship before thee  for thy judgments are made manifest  
5 	and after that i looked  and  behold  the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened  
6	and the seven angels came out of the temple  having the seven plagues  clothed in pure and white linen  and having their breasts girded with golden girdles  
7	and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god  who liveth for ever and ever  
8	and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god  and from his power  and no man was able to enter into the temple  till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled  
revelation 16
1 	and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels  go your ways  and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth  
2	and the first went  and poured out his vial upon the earth  and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast  and  upon  them which worshipped his image  
3	and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea  and it became as the blood of a dead  man   and every living soul died in the sea  
4	and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters  and they became blood  
5	and i heard the angel of the waters say  thou art righteous  o lord  which art  and wast  and shalt be  because thou hast judged thus  
6	for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets  and thou hast given them blood to drink  for they are worthy  
7	and i heard another out of the altar say  even so  lord god almighty  true and righteous  are  thy judgments  
8 	and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun  and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire  
9	and men were scorched with great heat  and blasphemed the name of god  which hath power over these plagues  and they repented not to give him glory  
10	and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast  and his kingdom was full of darkness  and they gnawed their tongues for pain  
11	and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores  and repented not of their deeds  
12 	and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates  and the water thereof was dried up  that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared  
13	and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs  come  out of the mouth of the dragon  and out of the mouth of the beast  and out of the mouth of the false prophet  
14	for they are the spirits of devils  working miracles   which  go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world  to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty  
15	behold  i come as a thief  blessed  is  he that watcheth  and keepeth his garments  lest he walk naked  and they see his shame  
16	and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon  
17 	and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air  and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven  from the throne  saying  it is done  
18	and there were voices  and thunders  and lightnings  and there was a great earthquake  such as was not since men were upon the earth  so mighty an earthquake   and  so great  
19	and the great city was divided into three parts  and the cities of the nations fell  and great babylon came in remembrance before god  to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath  
20	and every island fled away  and the mountains were not found  
21	and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven   every stone  about the weight of a talent  and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail  for the plague thereof was exceeding great  
revelation 17
1 	and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials  and talked with me  saying unto me  come hither  i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters  
2	with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication  and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication  
3	so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness  and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast  full of names of blasphemy  having seven heads and ten horns  
4	and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour  and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls  having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication  
5	and upon her forehead  was  a name written  mystery  babylon the great  the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth  
6	and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints  and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus  and when i saw her  i wondered with great admiration  
7 	and the angel said unto me  wherefore didst thou marvel  i will tell thee the mystery of the woman  and of the beast that carrieth her  which hath the seven heads and ten horns  
8	the beast that thou sawest was  and is not  and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit  and go into perdition  and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder  whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world  when they behold the beast that was  and is not  and yet is  
9	and here  is  the mind which hath wisdom  the seven heads are seven mountains  on which the woman sitteth  
10	and there are seven kings  five are fallen  and one is   and  the other is not yet come  and when he cometh  he must continue a short space  
11	and the beast that was  and is not  even he is the eighth  and is of the seven  and goeth into perdition  
12	and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings  which have received no kingdom as yet  but receive power as kings one hour with the beast  
13	these have one mind  and shall give their power and strength unto the beast  
14 	these shall make war with the lamb  and the lamb shall overcome them  for he is lord of lords  and king of kings  and they that are with him  are  called  and chosen  and faithful  
15	and he saith unto me  the waters which thou sawest  where the whore sitteth  are peoples  and multitudes  and nations  and tongues  
16	and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast  these shall hate the whore  and shall make her desolate and naked  and shall eat her flesh  and burn her with fire  
17	for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will  and to agree  and give their kingdom unto the beast  until the words of god shall be fulfilled  
18	and the woman which thou sawest is that great city  which reigneth over the kings of the earth  
revelation 18
1 	and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven  having great power  and the earth was lightened with his glory  
2	and he cried mightily with a strong voice  saying  babylon the great is fallen  is fallen  and is become the habitation of devils  and the hold of every foul spirit  and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird  
3	for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication  and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her  and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies  
4	and i heard another voice from heaven  saying  come out of her  my people  that ye be not partakers of her sins  and that ye receive not of her plagues  
5	for her sins have reached unto heaven  and god hath remembered her iniquities  
6	reward her even as she rewarded you  and double unto her double according to her works  in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double  
7	how much she hath glorified herself  and lived deliciously  so much torment and sorrow give her  for she saith in her heart  i sit a queen  and am no widow  and shall see no sorrow  
8	therefore shall her plagues come in one day  death  and mourning  and famine  and she shall be utterly burned with fire  for strong  is  the lord god who judgeth her  
9 	and the kings of the earth  who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her  shall bewail her  and lament for her  when they shall see the smoke of her burning  
10	standing afar off for the fear of her torment  saying  alas  alas  that great city babylon  that mighty city  for in one hour is thy judgment come  
11	and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her  for no man buyeth their merchandise any more  
12	the merchandise of gold  and silver  and precious stones  and of pearls  and fine linen  and purple  and silk  and scarlet  and all thyine wood  and all manner vessels of ivory  and all manner vessels of most precious wood  and of brass  and iron  and marble  
13	and cinnamon  and odours  and ointments  and frankincense  and wine  and oil  and fine flour  and wheat  and beasts  and sheep  and horses  and chariots  and slaves  and souls of men  
14	and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee  and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee  and thou shalt find them no more at all  
15	the merchants of these things  which were made rich by her  shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment  weeping and wailing  
16	and saying  alas  alas  that great city  that was clothed in fine linen  and purple  and scarlet  and decked with gold  and precious stones  and pearls  
17	for in one hour so great riches is come to nought  and every shipmaster  and all the company in ships  and sailors  and as many as trade by sea  stood afar off  
18	and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning  saying  what  city is  like unto this great city  
19	and they cast dust on their heads  and cried  weeping and wailing  saying  alas  alas  that great city  wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness  for in one hour is she made desolate  
20	rejoice over her   thou  heaven  and  ye  holy apostles and prophets  for god hath avenged you on her  
21	and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone  and cast  it  into the sea  saying  thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down  and shall be found no more at all  
22	and the voice of harpers  and musicians  and of pipers  and trumpeters  shall be heard no more at all in thee  and no craftsman  of whatsoever craft  he be   shall be found any more in thee  and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee  
23	and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee  and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee  for thy merchants were the great men of the earth  for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived  
24	and in her was found the blood of prophets  and of saints  and of all that were slain upon the earth  
revelation 19
1 	and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven  saying  alleluia  salvation  and glory  and honour  and power  unto the lord our god  
2	for true and righteous  are  his judgments  for he hath judged the great whore  which did corrupt the earth with her fornication  and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand  
3	and again they said  alleluia  and her smoke rose up for ever and ever  
4	and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne  saying  amen  alleluia  
5 	and a voice came out of the throne  saying  praise our god  all ye his servants  and ye that fear him  both small and great  
6	and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude  and as the voice of many waters  and as the voice of mighty thunderings  saying  alleluia  for the lord god omnipotent reigneth  
7	let us be glad and rejoice  and give honour to him  for the marriage of the lamb is come  and his wife hath made herself ready  
8	and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen  clean and white  for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints  
9	and he saith unto me  write  blessed  are  they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb  and he saith unto me  these are the true sayings of god  
10	and i fell at his feet to worship him  and he said unto me  see  thou do it  not  i am thy fellowservant  and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus  worship god  for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy  
11 	and i saw heaven opened  and behold a white horse  and he that sat upon him  was  called faithful and true  and in righteousness he doth judge and make war  
12	his eyes  were  as a flame of fire  and on his head  were  many crowns  and he had a name written  that no man knew  but he himself  
13	and he  was  clothed with a vesture dipped in blood  and his name is called the word of god  
14	and the armies  which were  in heaven followed him upon white horses  clothed in fine linen  white and clean  
15	and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword  that with it he should smite the nations  and he shall rule them with a rod of iron  and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god  
16	and he hath on  his  vesture and on his thigh a name written  king of kings  and lord of lords  
17	and i saw an angel standing in the sun  and he cried with a loud voice  saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven  come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god  
18	that ye may eat the flesh of kings  and the flesh of captains  and the flesh of mighty men  and the flesh of horses  and of them that sit on them  and the flesh of all  men  both  free and bond  both small and great  
19	and i saw the beast  and the kings of the earth  and their armies  gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse  and against his army  
20	and the beast was taken  and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him  with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast  and them that worshipped his image  these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone  
21	and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse  which  sword  proceeded out of his mouth  and all the fowls were filled with their flesh  
revelation 20
1 	and i saw an angel come down from heaven  having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand  
2	and he laid hold on the dragon  that old serpent  which is the devil  and satan  and bound him a thousand years  
3	and cast him into the bottomless pit  and shut him up  and set a seal upon him  that he should deceive the nations no more  till the thousand years should be fulfilled  and after that he must be loosed a little season  
4	and i saw thrones  and they sat upon them  and judgment was given unto them  and  i saw  the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus  and for the word of god  and which had not worshipped the beast  neither his image  neither had received  his  mark upon their foreheads  or in their hands  and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years  
5	but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished  this  is  the first resurrection  
6	blessed and holy  is  he that hath part in the first resurrection  on such the second death hath no power  but they shall be priests of god and of christ  and shall reign with him a thousand years  
7	and when the thousand years are expired  satan shall be loosed out of his prison  
8	and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth  gog and magog  to gather them together to battle  the number of whom  is  as the sand of the sea  
9	and they went up on the breadth of the earth  and compassed the camp of the saints about  and the beloved city  and fire came down from god out of heaven  and devoured them  
10	and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone  where the beast and the false prophet  are   and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever  
11 	and i saw a great white throne  and him that sat on it  from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away  and there was found no place for them  
12	and i saw the dead  small and great  stand before god  and the books were opened  and another book was opened  which is  the book  of life  and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books  according to their works  
13	and the sea gave up the dead which were in it  and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them  and they were judged every man according to their works  
14	and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire  this is the second death  
15	and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire  
revelation 21
1 	and i saw a new heaven and a new earth  for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away  and there was no more sea  
2	and i john saw the holy city  new jerusalem  coming down from god out of heaven  prepared as a bride adorned for her husband  
3	and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying  behold  the tabernacle of god  is  with men  and he will dwell with them  and they shall be his people  and god himself shall be with them   and be  their god  
4	and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes  and there shall be no more death  neither sorrow  nor crying  neither shall there be any more pain  for the former things are passed away  
5	and he that sat upon the throne said  behold  i make all things new  and he said unto me  write  for these words are true and faithful  
6	and he said unto me  it is done  i am alpha and omega  the beginning and the end  i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely  
7	he that overcometh shall inherit all things  and i will be his god  and he shall be my son  
8	but the fearful  and unbelieving  and the abominable  and murderers  and whoremongers  and sorcerers  and idolaters  and all liars  shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone  which is the second death  
9 	and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues  and talked with me  saying  come hither  i will shew thee the bride  the lamb s wife  
10	and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain  and shewed me that great city  the holy jerusalem  descending out of heaven from god  
11	having the glory of god  and her light  was  like unto a stone most precious  even like a jasper stone  clear as crystal  
12	and had a wall great and high   and  had twelve gates  and at the gates twelve angels  and names written thereon  which are  the names  of the twelve tribes of the children of israel  
13	on the east three gates  on the north three gates  on the south three gates  and on the west three gates  
14	and the wall of the city had twelve foundations  and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb  
15	and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city  and the gates thereof  and the wall thereof  
16	and the city lieth foursquare  and the length is as large as the breadth  and he measured the city with the reed  twelve thousand furlongs  the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal  
17	and he measured the wall thereof  an hundred  and  forty  and  four cubits   according to  the measure of a man  that is  of the angel  
18	and the building of the wall of it was  of  jasper  and the city  was  pure gold  like unto clear glass  
19	and the foundations of the wall of the city  were  garnished with all manner of precious stones  the first foundation  was  jasper  the second  sapphire  the third  a chalcedony  the fourth  an emerald  
20	the fifth  sardonyx  the sixth  sardius  the seventh  chrysolite  the eighth  beryl  the ninth  a topaz  the tenth  a chrysoprasus  the eleventh  a jacinth  the twelfth  an amethyst  
21	and the twelve gates  were  twelve pearls  every several gate was of one pearl  and the street of the city  was  pure gold  as it were transparent glass  
22	and i saw no temple therein  for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it  
23	and the city had no need of the sun  neither of the moon  to shine in it  for the glory of god did lighten it  and the lamb  is  the light thereof  
24	and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it  and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it  
25	and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day  for there shall be no night there  
26	and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it  
27	and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth  neither  whatsoever  worketh abomination  or  maketh  a lie  but they which are written in the lamb s book of life  
revelation 22
1 	and he shewed me a pure river of water of life  clear as crystal  proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb  
2	in the midst of the street of it  and on either side of the river   was there  the tree of life  which bare twelve  manner of  fruits   and  yielded her fruit every month  and the leaves of the tree  were  for the healing of the nations  
3	and there shall be no more curse  but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it  and his servants shall serve him  
4	and they shall see his face  and his name  shall be  in their foreheads  
5	and there shall be no night there  and they need no candle  neither light of the sun  for the lord god giveth them light  and they shall reign for ever and ever  
6 	and he said unto me  these sayings  are  faithful and true  and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done  
7	behold  i come quickly  blessed  is  he that keepeth the sayings of
